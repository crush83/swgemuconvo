You've done well.",		"a_no_progress":"Look, you are just getting in our way here.",		"a_tired_waiting":"This is for all the people who were killed because of you on Selaggis.",		"a_brushoff":"Maybe one day you'll get your priorities straight and help the Alliance.",		"a_thank_negotiate_again":"May the Force be with you. Let' go.",		"a_negotiate_fail":"No more talk, he pays for his war crimes now.",		"a_waiting":"Surround him. We don't want him trying to get away this time.",		"a_greet_mad":"Watch out, he's got reinforcements!",		"minion_5":"This is my first mission with the Alliance. Finally I get to bring the fight directly to the Empire. I'm hoping that I become famous someday, like Luke Skywalker.",		"minion_4":"I don't like dealing out this kind of retribution but sometimes there doesn't seem to be any other way to get through to the Imperials.",		"minion_3":"I hate the Empire. ",		"minion_2":"My wife has been imprisoned because of this Imperial scum. I don't even know where they are holding her.",		"minion_1":"He's responsible for the death of my brother.",		"a_thank_negotiate":"Thanks, you've given us hope in rescuing our friends. ",		"a_thank_combat":"One less Imperial to threaten innocent people. Thanks, pal.",		"a_respond_m_1":"Last chance? We've already taken out your "elite" troopers. ",		"m_greet_a":"This is your last change to surrender to me, rebels.",		"a_greet_m":"Thought you could run away?",		"m_waiting":"Now let's how those scum deal with an ambush against them.",		"m_thank_negotiate":"You've saved my neck.",		"response_negotiate":"Perhaps this doesn't need to end in more bloodshed. ",		"response_maybe":"Maybe",		"response_no":"No",		"response_yes":"Yes",		"m_negotiate_greet":"I will transmit the codes to their datapads now.

Fine, we accept.",		"a_decline_offer":"Oh right, we're going to trust him to send us to an Imperial Prison with some bogus authorization codes. Do we look stupid?",		"m_no_negotiate":"Release the prisoners? That is absurd. I don't have the authority to do that.",		"m_will_negotiate":"I would never be allowed to release them or pay any credits. I could give them the location of their friends and the authorization codes to open the cells. It's a minimum security prison so they should have little trouble releasing them. ",		"a_no_negotiate":"Yes. It does need to end in bloodshed.",		"a_maybe":"You're right. We've already taken out his Stormtroopers. You get him to authorize the release of all 35 imprisoned colonists and pay reparations for the families of the deceased and we'll let him go.",		"a_yes":"Good choice. Ok, let's finish this.",		"a_no":"So you support what he did? You are pathetic.",		"m_maybe":"It is understandable that you wouldn't want to confront people who bested a squad of Stormtroopers. Perhaps you could find a diplomatic way of protecting me.",		"a_greet_imperial":"Get out of our way. This Imperial is responsible for the deaths of 16 people and the imprisonment of 35 others. We're not looking for trouble with you, just him. You can help us if you want. Will you get out of our way?",		"a_greet_rebel":"Hello friend, we've tracked down this Imperial dog. He's the one responsible for the raid on a small colony on Selaggis. They couldn't pay a tax, so he ordered an attack on them. Killed 16 and hauled off another 35 to some Imperial prison. Will you let us handle this? ",		"m_thank_combat":"Excellent. Those rebels got exactly what they deserved.",		"m_no":"How dare you? It is your duty to the Empire to help your military when asked. ",		"m_yes":"Excellent. We shall teach them a lesson they won't soon forget.  ",		"a_greet":"This Imperial was responsible for a raid that killed 16 of our friends. Another 35 were captured and sent to an Imperial prison somewhere. Their only crime was refusal to pay an unscheduled tax. Will you let us do what we came her to do?",		"m_greet":"You there, in the name of the Empire I implore you to aid me. My Stormtroopers have been ambushed by Rebels. I barely escaped, but I think they are coming after me. Protect me."
