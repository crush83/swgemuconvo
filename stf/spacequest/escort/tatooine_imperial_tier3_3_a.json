		"title_d":"The fake orders have been planeted on this decoy shuttle. You are to follow the shuttle until the Rebels attack. You are going to have to make the Rebels believe that the shuttle contains highly important information. In order to do this, you need to destroy at least four waves of enemy fighters before they either destroy the decoy shuttle or the decoy shuttle reaches the end of its designated path.",		"title":"Endor System: Destroy Four Rebel Fighter Waves",		"thanks_5":"That's it! Keep it up. A little more of that and the Rebels will be absolutely convinced that this shuttle contains something really important.",		"thanks_4":"That's it! Keep it up.

The decoy shuttle is making a run for it and will let himself get captured. Keep a close watch, because it looks like the Rebels have also developed an unhealthy interest in you. Destroy any vessels that attack you and stand by for further notice.",		"shields_depleted":"There went our shields. We can't let them capture me too early. The Rebels may be weak but they are not dumb. If they take me too easily, they will never buy it.",		"reason_5":"Alright! We have the fake plans on our ship. Remember, you need to make this look real! Once the enemy attacks, destroy several of their attacking waves to make them think you are protecting some valuable information. Once we have done enough to sell our project, I will pretend to make a run for it and let the shuttle be captured.",		"reason_4":"Alright! We have the fake plans on our ship.

I have to stay alive for longer or the Rebels will not buy the fake plans. Get them off of me and destroy some more waves!",		"goodbye_5":"Blast it! You didn't destroy nearly enough of those fighters for the Rebels to be interested in following me. This mission is a big failure. Report back into your superior.",		"goodbye_4":"Blast it! You didn't destroy nearly enough of those fighters for the Rebels to be interested in following me. This mission is a big failure. Report back into your superior.",		"goodbye_3":"Blast it!

When we have their curiosity peeked, the shuttle will make a run for it and allow itself to be captured. Just make sure you put on a good show and destroy at least four attack waves.",		"failed_protect":"Pilot, that was too easy. The Rebels might scan the wreckage and find the plans but they are never going to believe them.  They are rebellious, not stupid.

Get back here and put on a good show.",		"escort_too_far1":"Pilot, if you leave the decoy shuttle unprotected the Rebels will know something is wrong. Stay with the shuttle and destroy those Rebels so they think what is on that shuttle is important.",		"complete":"You may have succeeded in getting the Rebels the plans but there is very little chance that they are going to believe that they are real.
