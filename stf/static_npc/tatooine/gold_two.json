		"next":"I'd hire you again but I hope to be off of this miserable desert hole really soon. Check back with me if you have time, you never know when something might foul up my plan to get out of here.",		"player_sorry_3":"Ummm... no, I'm not.  And... um... they're not all taken care of yet.  I'll let you know when to run.",		"player_sorry_2":"Not yet.  He's approaching as we speak, so I can take care of him.",		"player_reset_3":"You know what?  I can't help you with this.  This is way to risky!",		"player_reset_2":"Sorry, I've ahad a change of heart.  I don't want to get involved with this guy.",		"npc_reset_3":"Yeah, I hear that. I feel silly just offering this deathtrap mission. But if I don't get off this barren Sarlacc-pit, I'm gonna dissolve in my own bile.",		"npc_reset_2":"I absolutely don't blame you. Not my idea of a fun time. I expect I'll just hang back here until they find me or I slowly strangle on dust.",		"npc_backtowork_3":"Oh.  Okay, well, I still thank you!  Just say the word!",		"npc_backtowork_2":"I appreciate you helping me.  I didn't think I'd find anybody who cares on this back - ah - backwards planet!",		"npc_breech_3":"There's the target! Fire!",		"npc_breech_2":"Halt!",		"npc_breech_1":"A hostile! Open fire!",		"npc_work_3":"You were able to deal with them already?  Are you a Jedi?",		"npc_work_2":"Was the Mounted Stormtrooper taken care of?",		"npc_work_1":"Are there any more of the stormtroopers around?",		"cantwork":"You! Can you help --? Oh. Never mind. I see you're busy. Maybe you could check back later, assuming I'm still stuck on this rock.",		"npc_reset_1":"Yeah, I wouldn't look forward to facing stormtroopers either. Thanks anyway.",		"npc_backtowork_1":"Thank you very much, my newly found friend.",		"player_sorry_1":"I believe there are a few left.  I'll take care of the remaining ones shortly.",		"player_reset_1":"I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind.  I can't do this anymore.",		"player_3_3":"How are you getting offworld?",		"player_3_2":"How are you doing? You look a little stressed. ",		"player_3_1":"How did you crash here?",		"player_2_3":"Now you're being ridiculous!  I'm not dealing with a whole squad!",		"player_2_2":"Stormtroopers are one thing.  A mounted one is another.  Sorry, I can't help.",		"player_2_1":"I don't want to tangle with Stormtroopers.",		"player_1_3":"I'll hold them off for you!",		"player_1_2":"Sure, I'll lend a hand.",		"player_1_1":"Calm down.  I'll help you.",		"npc_reward_3":"I don't believe it! I'm in the clear! You've saved me, my friend! Now I have to get to Mos Espa and jump off this despicable sand-blown crime-ridden Hutt-run krayt-loving hive of scum and villainy. Thanks!",		"npc_reward_2":"Good news. Okay, it's possible I may actually pull through this. If you've got more time and want more money, check back with me.",		"npc_reward_1":"All right, all right, my life is just that much less terrible. I appreciate your help. If you want more work, I've still got trouble, so check back.",		"npc_4_3":"The Alliance is arranging a hot new X-wing and a clear docking bay with my name on it, just as soon as I can get there. But there's this matter of the patrol to deal with first. And your choice is --?",		"npc_4_2":"Stressed! Yeah, you might say that. I woke up this morning and a rock-mite was eating my boots! Just one more attraction here on Tatooine, sun-drenched center for life-threatening recreation. Now, about that trooper --? ",		"npc_4_1":"I'd just finished running a cargo of medical supplies through the Imperial blockade. On my way back up, they caught me. I barely survived the crash. Now I'm stuck on this dessicated rockball. Help!",		"npc_3_3":"Yeah, I hear that. I feel silly just offering this deathtrap mission. But if I don't get off this barren Sarlacc-pit, I'm gonna dissolve in my own bile.",		"npc_3_2":"I absolutely don't blame you. Not my idea of a fun time. I expect I'll just hang back here until they find me or I slowly strangle on dust.",		"npc_3_1":"Yeah, I wouldn't look forward to facing stormtroopers either. Thanks anyway.",		"npc_2_3":"I won't forget what you're doing for me. You're risking a lot to bail me out of a tough, tough spot. Good luck!",		"npc_2_2":"Okay, good, good. The trooper has a dewback, and the mount may make trouble too. Endless excitement in this dismal sandtrap.",		"npc_2_1":"Great. Get to the troopers and shoot them before they can report on my whereabouts. Watch out for sandtraps. I hate all this sand.",		"npc_1_3":"I can't shake the rest of the patrol. This is the toughest bunch yet -- probably three or four troopers plus the leader. If you take them out, you'll clear the way for my mad dash to Mos Espa. What do you say?",		"npc_1_2":"The hunt is intensifying. But if you destroy this one mounted trooper, you'll make it look like I'm somewhere other than here. That might divert the search. Interested?",		"npc_1_1":"A couple of stormtroopers are headed this way. I really severely don't need to see them. If you dispose of them, I'm that much closer to getting out of this backwater. Except, excuse me, there's no water! Back-dump! Back-pit! Help me!"
