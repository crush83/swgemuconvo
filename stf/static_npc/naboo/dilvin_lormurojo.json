Anyway, I just learned Borvo has kidnapped my pet monkey-lizard, Giggler. He's probably using poor Giggler as bait to trap me. But it won't work! I'll out-think him! I'll -- well, can I hire you to take care of this?

My beloved wife, Sindria, can't visit me too often without tipping off my location to observers. But she makes frequent visits to the image designers to assume new disguises. She's just changed her appearance again -- don't know what she looks like now -- but she's waiting in the wilderness at the usual rendezvous. Can you escort her here?",		"player_3_2":"What is the new satire?",		"player_2_2":"No.",		"player_1_2":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_2":"",		"gotowork_2":"",		"npc_smuggle_2":"",		"npc_dropoff_2":"",		"npc_takeme_2":"",		"npc_breech_2":"You work for the guy that wrote this trash?

The thug you stopped before stole my latest satire from my cabin. He gave it to a couple of his buddies to take to Borvo. This manuscript was, unfortunately, even more caustic than the first. Discretion moved me to suppress it. If Borvo sees it, he'll redouble his efforts.

I wish you'd get started.",		"npc_4_1":"Well, uh -- Borvo didn't like the poem's criticism of his wardrobe and general taste. And I also made certain corrupt officials look bad for dealing with Borvo. That ended a few careers. Borvo had to start over. Now he wants revenge. Can I count on you to stop him?",		"npc_3_1":"No? Oh. Well, uh, thanks anyway. I'll try to find someone else to save my life.",		"npc_2_1":"Oh, good. My informant says the thug was last seen at these coodinates in the wilderness. After you stop him, check back here.",		"npc_1_1":"Uh, hello -- I think. You're not with Borvo the Hutt, are you? I ask because I wrote that poem, "Borvo's Other Nose." If you're not with Borvo, I have a job for you. Borvo has learned I'm the one responsible for that satire, and he's ordered thugs all over Naboo to look for me. I just heard that a thug has checked my vacation cabin. He must have found records of my purchases at this cafe, because he's headed this way. Stop him!",		"notyet":"Sorry, I'm too busy to talk to you right now.",		"npc_reset_1":"Oh. Well, uh, okay. I hope you'll check back when you're ready.",		"cantwork":"Oh. Hello. If, uh, if you're not with Borvo the Hutt, can I ask you to check with me here? When you're not so busy? If you're not with Borvo.",		"next":"I just need to time my departure to get away from here. I don't need any help right now."
