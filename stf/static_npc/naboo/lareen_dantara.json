I'm not surprised, they're sneaky. Well, thanks anyway.",		"npc_noloc_2":"That's good -- no, wait. I've got a tour group ambling through that area just now. This would be a bad time to kill animals there. Check back with me later.",		"npc_work_2":"Hmm, didn't expect you back. Not yet done putting down that mott, I see. Well then, get to it.",		"npc_reward_2":"Thanks. That mott was just a nuisance before, digging up my garden and whatnot. But this could have been a plague. Well then, you've proven you have gumption. Go on in, look around -- but don't tell anyone I let you in.",		"npc_backtowork_2":"I've got nothing more to tell you about this mott. Get to it.",		"npc_4_2":"If you can picture a little garbage masher on four legs and covered with fur and tusks, that's a mott. Ill-tempered and brusque, in contrast to my own sweet nature. Well then, about this job -- will you take it?",		"npc_3_2":"And you made yourself so useful before. Guess that was the exception. Well then, goodbye.",		"npc_2_2":"Good. I'll be here waiting, just like before. Come on back after you've put down the mott.",		"npc_1_2":"Interested in more work, are you? Well then, if you take care of one more little matter, I'll let you into the retreat -- assuming you don't have an invitation already. I think that krahbu infected a local mott with some Corellian virus. The disease must have driven the thing crazy. You have to put it down before the epidemic spreads.",		"player_3_1":"Who owns this private retreat?",		"player_2_1":"No.",		"player_1_1":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_1":"",		"gotowork_1":"",		"npc_smuggle_1":"",		"npc_dropoff_1":"",		"npc_takeme_1":"",		"npc_breech_1":"",		"dontknowyou_1":"",		"otherescort_1":"",		"npc_failure_1":"Couldn't catch that krahbu, eh? I'm not surprised, they're fast. Well, thanks anyway.",		"npc_noloc_1":"That's good -- no, wait. I remember, I've got a tour group ambling through that area just now. This would be a bad time to kill animals there. Check back with me later.",		"npc_work_1":"Hmm, didn't expect you back. Not yet done putting down that krahbu, I see. Well then, get to it.",		"npc_reward_1":"Sorry to see that animal put down, but it had to be done. Invading species, you know. Here's a reward. If you have an invitation, go right in. Otherwise -- well then, talk to me about another little job, and after that, I'd be willing to let you in to look around.",		"npc_backtowork_1":"I've got nothing more to tell you about that krahbu. Get to it.",		"npc_4_1":"This is the Lake Retreat of the Naberrie family, one of the most honored families in Naboo history. Queen Padme Amidala was a Naberrie, along with several former senators and many high officials. Now, about that job --",		"npc_3_1":"Well then. I expect you'll find some nice place to visit, other than here. Goodbye.",		"npc_2_1":"Good. I'll wait for you here. Come on back after you've put down the krahbu. Be careful.",		"npc_1_1":"Sorry, this is a private family retreat. You can go in if you have an invitation. Otherwise -- well then, you might make yourself useful. Want a job? A Corellian visitor brought in a pet krahbu -- one of those big, fast mount animals -- and it got loose. Something drove it crazy -- maybe when it ate the local plants. Now this pest is killing local wildlife and livestock. Find the krahbu and kill it.",		"notyet":"Sorry, I need some time alone.",		"npc_reset_1":"All right, I understand. I hope you'll check back later when you're ready.",		"cantwork":"Sorry, this is a private family retreat. Can't let you in unless you have an invitation. Funny, you look too busy to enjoy the place.",		"next":"You again? Well then, I guess I can let you look around some more. Go on in."
