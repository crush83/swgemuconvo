See me again later and try again.",		"npc_reset_4":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",		"npc_reset_3":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",		"npc_reset_2":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",		"player_3_6":"Is it safe for me to handle this virus?",		"player_2_6":"No.",		"player_1_6":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_6":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_6":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_6":"What's that? You were supposed to give me something different.",		"gotowork_6":"Where's my package?",		"npc_smuggle_6":"That's what I've been waiting for. Take care.",		"npc_dropoff_6":"",		"npc_takeme_6":"",		"npc_breech_6":"Hey! Are you the courier from Borvo?",		"dontknowyou_6":"Sorry, I can't talk right now.",		"otherescort_6":"I'm waiting for somebody else. ",		"npc_failure_6":"Very regrettable. My Corellian business associates will not be happy about this. ",		"npc_noloc_6":"They haven't paid me, so I don't want it delivered quite yet. Come back and see me later.",		"npc_work_6":"You haven't delivered it yet? My buyer is waiting.",		"npc_reward_6":"You're everything a Hutt could want in an employee. ",		"npc_backtowork_6":"I can't tell you anything more. Please -- just make the delivery.",		"npc_4_6":"We've not yet managed to engineer a strain that works on sapient creatures, so you should be completely safe. Will you do it?",		"npc_3_6":"I completely understand. I too am wary of handling this sort of biohazard.",		"npc_2_6":"Fine, fine. Kritus Morven is very keen to get in on this operation, so be careful that he doesn't foul up this delivery. I don't want anything to upset my buyer.",		"npc_1_6":"Do you know much about the Berserker Virus? It's an ailment that has recently been infecting the creatures of Naboo. It makes them unusually aggressive. I'm selling a sample of the virus to a buyer from Corellia. You've been very dependable so far. Will you deliver the sample?",		"player_3_5":"How did he get in trouble with the Royal Security Forces?",		"player_2_5":"No.",		"player_1_5":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_5":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_5":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_5":"",		"gotowork_5":"",		"npc_smuggle_5":"",		"npc_dropoff_5":"Thanks for getting me here.",		"npc_takeme_5":"Royal Security, Imperial Security. How am I supposed to keep track of all these details? Just help get me off this world.",		"npc_breech_5":"Did the Hutt send you to find somebody?",		"dontknowyou_5":"I'm afraid I don't have time for idle chitchat. ",		"otherescort_5":"I don't know who your looking for, but I do know it isn't me.",		"npc_failure_5":"I do so hate to lose an opportunity to make credits. Oh well, no use worrying about what we can't change.",		"npc_noloc_5":"Actually, things are a little hot for him right now. I'll send you to find him when things have cooled down a little.",		"npc_work_5":"If you don't find him soon, the Royal Security Forces will.",		"npc_reward_5":"I admire your resourcefulness. You've done very well.",		"npc_backtowork_5":"Hurry up and bring him to me, or neither of us will make any credits off this situation.",		"npc_4_5":"Let's just say he rashly assumed that a Naboo Royal Security Forces ship belonged to the Empire. At the time, he was doing something the Imperials wouldn't like, and so he took action. Very regrettable. Will you bring him to me?",		"npc_3_5":"Very prudent of you not to meddle in Rebel affairs. The Empire is not well disposed toward that sort of behavior. ",		"npc_2_5":"Your loyalty is an inspiration to all who know you. The pilot's name is Naz Tulos. Bring him to me before Royal Security catches up with him.",		"npc_1_5":"This business never gets dull. A pilot known to be friendly to the Alliance has managed to get in trouble with Naboo security instead of the Imperials. I'm being paid to smuggle him off-planet. Will you bring him to me?",		"player_3_4":"How has he been drawing attention to you?",		"player_2_4":"No.",		"player_1_4":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_4":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_4":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_4":"",		"gotowork_4":"",		"npc_smuggle_4":"",		"npc_dropoff_4":"",		"npc_takeme_4":"",		"npc_breech_4":"I work for Borvo the Hutt, you fool! You can't touch me!",		"dontknowyou_4":"What are you bothering me for? Get a job.",		"otherescort_4":"I know you're not here to see me.",		"npc_failure_4":"I was so sure you could make him behave. How regrettable.",		"npc_noloc_4":"Actually, I'm not sure where he is right now. See me later, and with luck I'll have the coordinates you need.",		"npc_work_4":"Haven't you yet shown my lieutenant the error of his ways?",		"npc_reward_4":"That's one way to keep someone from misbehaving. You should have been born a Hutt.",		"npc_backtowork_4":"I really need you to attend to this matter with all speed.",		"npc_4_4":"Demanding money from merchants. Shooting people who annoy him, and then warning witnesses "who his boss is" and how "they'd better keep quiet." Killing the security officer who was investigating his case. Things like that. All very regrettable. Will you help me?",		"npc_3_4":"Once again your wisdom astounds me. You're right, this is a family matter, and I should attend to it myself.",		"npc_2_4":"Deal with him as you think best, of course. I've learned to trust your judgment. I warn you, though -- he's very full of himself and may not be willing to listen to reason.",		"npc_1_4":"My friend, I need your help in a delicate matter involving my business. One of my lieutenants thinks that because he works for me, he can do anything he wishes. He's been drawing unwanted attention to my organization. Can you help me deal with him?",		"player_3_3":"Why does she need an escort?",		"player_2_3":"No.",		"player_1_3":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_3":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_3":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_3":"",		"gotowork_3":"",		"npc_smuggle_3":"",		"npc_dropoff_3":"Thanks for getting me here. I never could have made it by myself.",		"npc_takeme_3":"I'm so glad you're here. My previous escort was killed by a narglatch.",		"npc_breech_3":"Did Borvo send you?",		"dontknowyou_3":"I'm busy right now and don't have time to talk.",		"otherescort_3":"Sorry, I'm waiting for somebody else. ",		"npc_failure_3":"You failed me? Words can not express my surprise and regret. I'm sure you won't let it happen again.",		"npc_noloc_3":"It occurs to me -- this could be a valuable lesson to teach her not to lose her escort. I think I'll have you bring her back later. ",		"npc_work_3":"You mean she's still waiting out in the wilderness? Well, go get her!",		"npc_reward_3":"Where others would fail, you succeed. Well done.",		"npc_backtowork_3":"Please hurry and bring back my scientist. ",		"npc_4_3":"She actually had an escort when she left -- I'm not sure what happened to him. She's a scientist and not used to defending herself. Will you bring her back?",		"npc_3_3":"I admire your sense of self-preservation. It's dangerous out in the wilderness.",		"npc_2_3":"I knew I could count on you. Her work is very important to me, so please bring her back safely. I'm sure she's completely unnerved out there in the wilderness.",		"npc_1_3":"I have need of you once more, my friend. One of my employees, a scientist, is out getting samples for a business venture, but she needs an escort to get back safely. Will you help me?",		"player_3_2":"What sort of childish antics?",		"player_2_2":"No.",		"player_1_2":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_2":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_2":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_2":"",		"gotowork_2":"",		"npc_smuggle_2":"",		"npc_dropoff_2":"",		"npc_takeme_2":"",		"npc_breech_2":"",		"dontknowyou_2":"",		"otherescort_2":"",		"npc_failure_2":"What a pity. I thought you'd be able to handle that. Very regrettable.",		"npc_noloc_2":"Perhaps we should wait a bit on that destruction. I have just received news that may alter the social landscape. Meet with me later.",		"npc_work_2":"Why haven't you destroyed that building yet?",		"npc_reward_2":"Excellent. Once again you have my gratitude.",		"npc_backtowork_2":"You know all that you require. Go destroy that building. ",		"npc_4_2":"Petty things, really. Like telling Naboo Security the location of some of my hidden installations. Will you discourage such escapades on my behalf?",		"npc_3_2":"Truly your years belie your wisdom. It would indeed be foolish to get caught up in our struggle.",		"npc_2_2":"Ah, so like myself -- willing to negotiate but unafraid of conflict. Kritus recently shipped a valuable commodity to Naboo that he is temporarily storing at one of his smuggling dens. I want you to destroy the building, contents and all.",		"npc_1_2":"I fear your previous efforts on my behalf bore little fruit. Kritus Morven lets his dislike of me cloud his judgment. Speaking of my illustrious competitor, you might assist me in teaching him a lesson. He's been crossing the line recently, and I want to discourage his childish antics.",		"player_3_1":"Who is getting this message?",		"player_2_1":"No.",		"player_1_1":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_1":"I think you meant to give me something different.",		"gotowork_1":"You didn't bring the message? ",		"npc_smuggle_1":"I'll bring this to Mr. Morven right away.",		"npc_dropoff_1":"",		"npc_takeme_1":"",		"npc_breech_1":"Are you here to deliver the message from Borvo?",		"dontknowyou_1":"I'm here waiting for someone.",		"otherescort_1":"You and I don't have any business to discuss.",		"npc_failure_1":"Regrettable that you weren't able to succeed, but these things happen.",		"npc_noloc_1":"Now that I think of it, this may not be the best time to deliver such a message. See me about this again later.",		"npc_work_1":"Haven't you delivered my message yet? I'm a patient Hutt, but --",		"npc_reward_1":"A thousand thanks, my friend. I have the feeling you and I shall get along very well.",		"npc_backtowork_1":"That's all I can tell you right now. Please proceed with the task.",		"npc_4_1":"A rival of mine, Kritus Morven. Recently things have been getting out of hand between us. All that bad blood is bad for business and draws unwanted attention. Will you help me arrange a sit-down?",		"npc_3_1":"Perhaps you are wise not to put yourself between rivals such as Kritus and myself.",		"npc_2_1":"You have the heart of a Jedi, always willing to aid the cause of peace. Bring my message to the courier waiting outside the city. We tend to conduct these affairs away from places where people might notice.",		"npc_1_1":"Welcome. I am Borvo. You needn't look so nervous. I never eat my guests -- at least not without tea, and you've just missed that. As it happens, I need some short-term help. My regular people are busy with a new project. Do you think you might be willing to deliver a message for me?",		"notyet":"I lack time to talk to you at the moment. Very regrettable, I know. But please talk with my lieutenant in Keren, Bardo Klinj.",		"npc_reset_1":"Sometimes unforeseen difficulties make our work harder. See me again later and try again.",		"cantwork":"See me again when you've finished with your present employer.",		"next":"Business is running smoothly. But if I have any more difficulties, you're my first choice to solve them."
