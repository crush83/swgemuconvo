That isn't it.",		"gotowork_2":"I was expecting Grondorn Muse's arrangement of "Corellia Ho." Don't you have it?",		"npc_smuggle_2":"I wondered if I'd get this. That Grondorn -- talented, I grant you, but he couldn't remember to put his shirt on unless he got a written order.",		"npc_dropoff_2":"",		"npc_takeme_2":"",		"npc_breech_2":"Are you bringing Muse's arrangement of "Corellia Ho"?",		"dontknowyou_2":"I'd prefer not to get into a conversation right now.",		"otherescort_2":"I'm expecting someone else, actually.",		"npc_failure_2":"You didn't deliver that arrangement? Oh well, I'll try to send another copy to Pytor.",		"npc_noloc_2":"Sorry, I'm getting a call about the new orders. Let me just take this, and then check back with me in a moment.",		"npc_work_2":"Have you delivered that arrangement of "Corellia Ho"? The Battling 166th is waiting.",		"npc_reward_2":"Thanks. Now the Battling 166th Troubadours can hold rehearsals out there in the wilderness -- which, if you've ever heard them play, you know is probably for the best.",		"npc_backtowork_2":"I hope you'll get started soon and deliver that arrangement.",		"npc_4_2":"You must know that tune -- brace up, Corellia, stand firm and tall? None shall subdue you, you'll never fall? Go your own way and let none hold you back, for your future calls you ever ever on-n-n-n-n? No? Well, it's a rouser. I hope you'll deliver my arrangement.",		"npc_3_2":"Well, thanks for your earlier help, anyway.",		"npc_2_2":"Great. You want to find the Battling 166th band leader, Pytor Tuko. He's out in the wilderness on a training exercise.",		"npc_1_2":"I need your help again. I promised to deliver this arrangement of "Corellia Ho!" to the band leader of the Battling 166th Troubadours. Unfortunately, I have to wait here for new militia orders. Can you deliver it for me? I'll pay you.",		"player_3_1":"Why did you forget and leave your kloo horn behind?",		"player_2_1":"No.",		"player_1_1":"Yes.",		"player_sorry_1":"I'll keep working on the mission.",		"player_reset_1":"I don't want this mission right now.",		"notit_1":"",		"gotowork_1":"",		"npc_smuggle_1":"",		"npc_dropoff_1":"Thanks. Grondorn, here's your horn, along with a datadisc I found beside it. I guess you forgot everything but your trousers, huh?",		"npc_takeme_1":"I swear, that Grondorn Muse could forget his own trousers sometimes. He'll get in big trouble for that someday. Can you guide me back? I have a poor sense of direction.",		"npc_breech_1":"Are you here to bring me to Grondorn? I have his kloo horn!",		"dontknowyou_1":"I haven't got anything to say to you.",		"otherescort_1":"I'm waiting for another party.",		"npc_failure_1":"You didn't bring Vincol back? I hope he's all right.

Check with me in a few moments.",		"npc_work_1":"I need you to bring back our band member, Vincol Dunker, and my kloo horn. Are you having trouble finding him?",		"npc_reward_1":"Thanks. Please accept this for your good work. Wait -- Vincol's brought that new arrangement, too. I forgot all about that! Check with me again if you want another job.",		"npc_backtowork_1":"I hope you're ready to move out and retrieve Vincol and my kloo horn.",		"npc_4_1":"Look, you try herding a pack of wayward Serenaders out in the middle of nowhere, and you'll lose track of details too. I hope if you can get the band member and my horn back safely, I won't get into trouble with my commander. Will you bring him here?",		"npc_3_1":"Sorry to hear that. This whole situation is rapidly becoming a fiasco.",		"npc_2_1":"Thanks. The band member's name is Vincol Dunker. He found my kloo horn, so don't let anything happen to him. That might hurt the horn. Sorry, just joking.",		"npc_1_1":"Hello. I was out with our militia's band, the Fighting 357th Serenaders, on a training exercise. When we returned to base, I forgot my kloo horn. One of our band members went to retrieve it, but he just called to say he got lost. If you'll escort him here safely, along with my kloo horn, I'll make it worth your while.",		"notyet":"",		"npc_reset":"I'm sorry to hear that. This situation is turning into a fiasco.",		"cantwork":"When you're not so busy, would you mind checking back with me?",		"next":"I have the militia band situation under control now, thanks to you."
