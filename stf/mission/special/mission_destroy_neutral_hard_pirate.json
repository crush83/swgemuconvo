		"number_of_entries":"12",		"m12t":"Audition for the Mighty Jabba",		"m12s":"You have demonstrated no small amount of skill.  I shall bring your case before the Illustrious Jabba.  Until you hear from us again, enjoy this well-earned payment.",		"m12o":"Bib Fortuna",		"m12l":"",		"m12i":"I give you the chance to impress Mighty Jabba and you respond by accusing me of giving you the wrong coordinates?  Very displeasing.",		"m12f":"Perhaps I was not clear when I warned applicants not to waste my time.  But I shall make it clear to you in due course.",		"m12d":"Mighty Jabba is always looking for new talent to add to his organization.  After some recent personnel issues, he has decided that all new recruits must prove themselves in a practical demonstration of their skills.  Illustrious Jabba wishes me to provide one such audition for a hit team.  To warrant their abilities, these assassins will be required to break into the landing bay of an especially lethal pirate captain and blast the entire facility into its component atoms.  Upon the completion of this task I shall present a report to the Invincible Jabba, who will render a decision on the worthiness of the applicants.  Wise job seekers should be aware that I do not take my duties lightly.  Only the finest and most despicable assassins deserve my attention; others are highly discouraged from occupying my precious time.",		"m11t":"Help us in our hour of need",		"m11s":"You did it!  It's a shame about the outpost being destroyed, but I just know that you did your best to protect it.  Please, take your reward and know that you are always welcome on my planet, where I will treat you to every pleasure my humble palace can provide.",		"m11o":"A Desperate Princess",		"m11l":"",		"m11i":"Goodness, did I send you the wrong coordinates?  I'm not very good at operating this input terminal.  I'm so, so sorry.",		"m11f":"Oh, dear, it's just awful that you couldn't help us.  You're very generous for trying.  I'm so sorry I can't pay you, but I must save our money so we can hire others to try where you failed.",		"m11d":"Oh, can't someone please help us?  My family rules a small but beautiful planet in Xappyh Sector.  Long ago we built an outpost to tend the needs of the poor and downtrodden in nearby systems.  But calamity befell us when our outpost was captured by the crew of a large and terribly frightening pirate frigate.  We would like to remove them so that we can resume helping the needy of the galaxy; but the regional governor has refused to lend us aid.  We are a peaceful planet and have no weapons.  We do have money, though, with which we shall gladly part if it means we can have our outpost back.  Are there no stalwart heroes left in the universe who will come to us in our hour of need?  These pirates are a cruel and awful lot and we are frightened that they might do harm to the poverty-stricken areas near them.  Money is no object.  Please, just help us!",		"m10t":"Dislodge pirates from my industrial villa",		"m10s":"Your work was sloppy in one or two particulars, but you did complete the task at hand.  Good job leveling the villa.  Do enjoy this payment.",		"m10o":"An Influential Neimoidian",		"m10l":"",		"m10i":"I gave you poor coordinates.  Clearly someone has been tampering with my databanks.  I shall investigate further.",		"m10f":"A good businessman does not encourage substandard practices.  I hired you on the assumption that you could complete the task at hand.  You shall not see one credit until then.",		"m10d":"They say lucre makes the galaxy spin and I have always found that to be true.  My various industrial enterprises have made me one of the most influential Neimoidians in nine sectors.  I have assets spanning a hundred systems.  When you attain such success, however, you become an attractive target for professional thieves.  I am no exception.  I have just discovered that one of my industrial villas has been overrun by several pirate crews.  Luckily a good businessman knows how to distribute resources to safeguard his investments.  I wish to disburse a very large sum of credits to a group of soldiers-of-fortune who have the means and the wherewithal to dislodge these slugs from my property.  Be warned: they are well-equipped and extremely dangerous.  I am paying for the best of the best, so don't waste my time if you're anything but elite.  Also, I shall shed no tears if the villa itself sustains heavy damage, as I intend to collect an insurance disbursement and shut the place down anyway.",		"m9t":"Retire an ex-pirate for good",		"m9s":"Very well done.  Have I hired you before?  You have the skill and the guts to be a player yourself.  You would make an excellent asset to my organization.",		"m9o":"Black Sun: Vigo Green",		"m9l":"",		"m9i":"You're right, those were bad coordinates.  That old pirate still has contacts inside my organization.  I'll have a little chat with the person who gave me those numbers.",		"m9f":"To be honest, I didn't expect you to finish this job.  Conveniently this means I don't have to pay you.  And now that my ex-employee thinks I have made my move, he will be overconfident when I send a hit team who actually knows how to kill a man.",		"m9d":"Every successful businessman deserves a luxurious retirement.  No one is denying that.  But a player is expected to settle all bets before cashing out of the game.  That is where a certain ex-employee of mine has failed.  He was one of the most successful pirates on my payroll.  A prolific provider for many standard years.  He retired with my personal blessing.  Unfortunately I have learned that he hid an old debt from me, and has rebuked my requests for payment.  I have extended every courtesy to him, but the time has now come to finalize negotiations.  I require a crack team of assassins to hit him hard and leave no one standing.  Only the deadliest killers need apply.  He knows I'm coming, so he has fortified himself in a stronghold and gathered a small army of the toughest scum in the sector.  Tear the place to the ground and you shall be very well compensated.  Contact me for his coordinates.",		"m8t":"Wipe out the pirates' haven",		"m8s":"Good work. Remember there's plenty more of those havens out there. We'll continue to pay as long as you continue to produce results.",		"m8o":"The Corporate Sector Authority",		"m8l":"",		"m8i":"Some of these havens are bogus, naturally. We have to check all these coordinates just to be sure though.",		"m8f":"If those ports are not completely destroyed, they will continue to be used by the pirates. No results, no reward. That should be pretty obvious.",		"m8d":"One of the major areas of concern for the Corporate Sector Authority is piracy. Our ships in particular draw those predators like skettos to a sleeping dewback. Recently we've discovered that many of these pirates have banded together to form some sort of "Brotherhood." By sharing information about transport movements, safe spaceports, and Imperial activity, these rogues can insure a higher rate of success for their comrades. We've used our resources, mostly in the form of bribes, to pinpoint the locations of some of the busiest spaceports used by this Brotherhood. We offer a substantial reward to anyone who can make sure these ports are knocked out of commission. There's plenty of work doing that as these criminals have dozens of these havens. Coordinates will be transmitted upon your acceptance. ",		"m7t":"Help a Hutt make a point",		"m7s":"Most effective. You serve my master well and you will be rewarded.",		"m7o":"Bib Fortuna",		"m7l":"",		"m7i":"Check those coordinates again - I do not make such mistakes. No one that rises so high in Jabba's estimation could make such mistakes.",		"m7f":"It seems you also do not share a particular rationality. Failure is rewarded with pain and death by Jabba. I shall now probably have to hire another group of assassins to take care of you. Ironic, isn't it?",		"m7d":"Mighty Jabba's wrath is a powerful and dreadful thing to incur - few rational beings wish to risk it. This band of pirates, it seems, do not share that particular rationality. They have been raiding my lord's spice shipments with impunity and this must stop. My lord was wise enough to have planted a spy in their midst months ago, suspecting that this particular band might try to double-cross him in the future. Thanks to my lord's wisdom, we know the location of this band's hidden base. Illustrious Jabba wishes me to hire the best assassins credits can buy and instruct them to practice their trade on these foolish rogues. Do you wish to take advantage of this opportunity to earn both my lord's favor and a substantial reward? ",		"m6t":"Swat Jabba's pirates",		"m6s":"I had a hunch about you. You seemed to be the type to get results. Congratulations on a job well done. Enjoy the reward.",		"m6o":"Lady Valarian",		"m6l":"",		"m6i":"We may have a spy in my network. I'll have to do some housecleaning.",		"m6f":"I guess you were lacking in one of those areas I mentioned in my message. Too bad you couldn't pull this off. I was hoping you would, actually.",		"m6d":"Jabba claims he doesn't want a war and then arranges for pirates to hit ships carrying goods intended for me. If that gargantuan worm thinks I can't see who's behind these recent attacks, he's as stupid as he looks. As much as I know that Jabba is baiting me, I must respond or I risk other pirates trying their hands at plucking my cargo. This mission won't be easy but it will pay very well. Jabba is known to employ the most ruthless and dangerous pirates in the trade. But a resourceful team of agents, skilled in teamwork and deadly with their blasters, should be able to pull it off. You fancy yourself such an individual? If you think so I'll send you the coordinates to the pirates' lair. ",		"m5t":"Blast the errant pirates",		"m5s":"Well done. Accept this reward and look me up again soon.",		"m5o":"Bib Fortuna",		"m5l":"",		"m5i":"Could the pirates have found the chip? Why were those coordinates incorrect? My slave had better not warned those space rogues.",		"m5f":"This is most disappointing. My brutish Gamorrean guards would have fared better. You should make yourself scarce.",		"m5d":"Normally I wouldn't care about the activities of pirates but these particular ones happened to strike a slaver ship on its way to deliver a shipment of Twi'lek exotic dancers to me. Even after the pirates discovered who this shipment was intended for, they still decided to sell the slaves on their own and keep all the profits. This matter must be resolved. I cannot allow pirates to seize what I have rightfully stolen - if word of this spreads it could weaken my position with Jabba. I therefore have need of a team of deadly killers to rid me of this embarrassment. One of the Twi'lek girls had a homing chip implanted in her thigh (a special gift intended for one of Jabba's rivals) which has allowed me to discover where these slugs are hiding. Accept the mission and the coordinates are yours. Leave no witnesses and burn their lair to the ground.",		"m4t":"Smash the notorious pirates",		"m4s":"An excellent strike. The Empire is indebted to you, agent. Perhaps you should contact us about helping to crush the Rebellion. We could use agents like you.",		"m4o":"Imperial Navy",		"m4l":"",		"m4i":"The pirates must have somehow sabotaged our transmission, which means they must know we've discovered their base. It will likely be abandoned soon.",		"m4f":"Those pirates will scatter like trash bats before our ships can arrive. This failure is terribly disappointing. We hope this is unusual for you. ",		"m4d":"One of the galaxy's most notorious and bloodthirsty band of pirates has fallen for our trap. They took some bait we offered and raided a ship full of tainted cargo. We planted undetectable homing beacons inside that cargo and now the pirates have led us right back to their lair. Their base sensors are rather sophisticated, however, so they would detect the approach of Imperial cruisers and escape into space before we could strike. We need a team of highly skilled and experienced agents to land near their base and take it out. The pirates would not react to the arrival of a standard transport as they're used to monitoring that sort of activity in their system. Are you the sort of operative that could assemble such a strike team? The Empire is counting on you, citizen. ",		"m3t":"Destroy pirates with a case of conscience",		"m3s":"Finally, someone who knows what they're good at and stick to it. A long, happy life will likely be yours, friend. Come see me again soon.",		"m3o":"Black Sun: Vigo Green",		"m3l":"",		"m3i":"We sent you the correct coordinates, buddy, I'm sure you're just reading them wrong. Sheesh, why does this have to be so hard?",		"m3f":"This is not what you do best, is it? Did you used to cook or fix ships for a living? Maybe you should go back to that.",		"m3d":"I've yet to meet someone who got into trouble by sticking to doing what they do best. It's only when a few malcontents, not happy with the status quo, try to do something different that we get problems. Or at least I do. Pirates aren't freedom fighters, right? You know that, I know that, everyone knows that. Pirates are thieves and murderers. That's what they do. And that's exactly what I need a small team of hired guns to explain to some former associates who've got it in their heads to help the Rebellion. Not on my watch. These scum think they can wipe their past clean by helping some moisture-farmers-turned-Rebels get themselves slaughtered by stormtroopers? Their case of sudden conscience is costing me too much money. Accept the job and I'll tell you where you need to go. Leave no walls standing. I want to make sure this conscience-acquiring is not contagious.",		"m2t":"Help clean out the pirate gene pool",		"m2s":"Good to see that some scum still care about professionalism. Good for you. Come look me up again when you need more work.",		"m2o":"Black Sun: Vigo Clezo",		"m2l":"",		"m2i":"There was a glitch in our transmission. We'll get it fixed and you can try again.",		"m2f":"Was the story of the incompetent pirates lost on you? You weren't trying to go for a sense of irony, were you? Why do I get the galaxy's clowns working for me?",		"m2d":"When pirates are hired to perform a job, they should stick to it regardless of the consequences. What's happening to professionalism in our circles? A renegade band of pirates has decided that they can keep the credits given to them for the performance of certain duties regardless of whether those duties were adequately performed or not. It is my responsibility to teach these slugs a lesson. I'm offering a reward to the team of hired killers that can infiltrate this band's base and blast it (and them) to pieces. If you accept, you'll be told where to go. These pirates are not likely to go down without a fight, so I'd blast first and ask questions later if I were you. Do you think you could take care of this problem for me?",		"m1t":"Remove the thorn",		"m1s":"Excellently done, agent. Your resourcefulness is most inspirational - a shining example to hired guns throughout the galaxy. Enjoy your lucre.",		"m1o":"Black Sun",		"m1l":"",		"m1i":"We rarely get these sorts of things wrong. Someone must be aiding those pirates, possibly a slicer. Check back with us later and I'm sure we'll have this cleared up.",		"m1f":"Angry pirates are even more of a nuisance than cocky ones. What a bother this has become. Your results have left us quite non-plussed.",		"m1d":"These pirates are almost as bad as those hotshot smugglers. If any of these rogues get the tiniest drop of notoriety, it goes straight to their heads. Suddenly they think they can set their own rules, do whatever they like, and ignore their benefactors. The result is nothing but headaches and work for us, but it also means good fortune for independent agents like yourself. We need a pirate band taken down. They've become too much of a liability for our organization and must now be squashed. A small elite team of troubleshooters ought to be able to take care of this situation with little trouble. If you've worked for us before, you know our pay is quite generous. If this is your first time, then prepare to be pleased when all this mess is settled. We'll send the coordinates to the pirate's lair upon receiving your acceptance."
