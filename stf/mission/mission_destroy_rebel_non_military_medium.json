		"number_of_entries":"50",		"m50t":"Imperial Laboratory",		"m50s":"Splendid! Our informants assure us that it will take years for the Empire to rebuild this new technology. By then, we may have discovered some means to counter it.",		"m50o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m50d":"Imperial hyperspace technology is advancing at an alarming rate. Most capital ships contain hyperwave signal interceptors that sound an alert just before a spacecraft comes out of hyperspace in their vicinity. Our spies inform us that an Imperial research laboratory has tripled the range of these hyperwave warning systems, giving them much more time to prepare for incoming enemies. The secret of this technology is entirely contained in the laboratory. We intend to raze the facility before any Imperial warships can benefit. We need a small team or a highly skilled individual to hit the place and blow it to cinders.",		"m49t":"Imperial Garrison",		"m49s":"Nicely handled. Your skill and bravery are assets to the Alliance.",		"m49o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m49d":"The grim story is all too common: A local notable crosses the Empire and a small garrison is placed on his land as a lesson to others. But a few, brave individuals continue to resist oppression. They have contacted the Alliance with requests to remove these garrisons from their land. Alliance High Command has decided to pursue several of these requests. We know several such garrisons, compact but well-defended, that require the attention of strike teams. The mission is simple: Hit each place hard and leave no survivors. Inasmuch as the Empire is so fond of lessons, it is time they learned one of their own.",		"m48t":"Dangerous Imperial Officer",		"m48s":"You have done very well. We have not yet confirmed that Commander Hrazzel was killed in your raid, but we hope his threat is now gone.",		"m48o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m48d":"An up-and-coming Imperial officer named Commander Hrazzel has shown a keen aptitude for ferreting out covert Alliance agents and destroying our hidden bases. What's worse, he is known to torture and slaughter innocents in his enforcement of Imperial edicts. We have learned his current itinerary, and have found that he is currently inspecting a facility on this world. We need a skilled individual or small squad to strike this facility while Hrazzel is present. With good planning, fortitude, and a bit of luck, we can eliminate this threat before he rises to become a galaxy-wide menace.",		"m47t":"Imperial Corruption of Our Youth",		"m47s":"Thanks to your good work, many troubled youths will avoid the corruption of the Empire and perhaps even become good Alliance fighters in the future.",		"m47o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m47d":"The Imperial Security Bureau has stepped up its program to recruit young, poor people as agents of the Empire. The ISB contacts troubled youths with a criminal record and pays them to do the Empire's dirty work, thus keeping the hands of the governors clean. We must not stand for this underhanded scheme. The program is controlled from an ISB facility at the following coordinates. We want to make an example of these ISB monsters, so leave no Imperial agent standing.",		"m46t":"Water-Doping Facility",		"m46s":"It warms the heart to see a plume of smoke rising where Imperial villainy once reigned. Very well done. Your reputation continues to rise here.",		"m46o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m46d":"The Empire is not above sedating its subjects into complacency. We have discovered an installation where Imperial engineers are introducing drugs into the water supply to quell unrest in the local population. This crime must not be allowed to continue. If the Empire's cowardice enrages you, and if you have the expertise to do something about it, please blast this water-doping facility into smoke and rubble. ",		"m45t":"Test Imperial Security Protocol",		"m45s":"It seems no Imperial security protocol is a match for a good blaster at your side. The Alliance thanks you.",		"m45o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m45d":"We have received word that a new security protocol has been implemented at Imperial military sites around the sector. We are staging exploratory assaults on select bases, to see what new tactics the Empire has deployed. We need small teams of marksmen or veteran individuals to assist us in this fact-finding endeavor. Leave no wall standing.",		"m44t":"Protect Covert Alliance Operation",		"m44s":"Well done! Against the military resources of the Empire we need every advantage we can get. Thank you.",		"m44o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m44d":"Force shield technology is a major factor in space battles. One of our undercover agents has covertly sabotaged Imperial masking codes for several uninstalled shield generators in this sector. If these generators are deployed to Imperial warships, we will have a hidden advantage should our blockade runners be spotted. Unfortunately certain factory records might betray our secret sabotage. We need agents to blow apart a small but well-guarded Imperial Navy maintenance base, thereby destroying the factory records that might reveal our scheme. Imperial bureaucracy being what it is, we are confident the shield generators will be deployed even without these records.",		"m43t":"Smash Propaganda Center",		"m43s":"Every time we take down a center for propaganda, the people of the galaxy move closer to the truth. You have done well.",		"m43o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m43d":"Propaganda is one of the Empire's tools in oppressing the galaxy. Imperial propagandists have taken over entire news corporations. We have identified one such purveyor of deceit, and confirmed that Imperial personnel staff all of its facilities. We offer a reward to worthy fighters who can smash this installation and staunch the flow of lies.",		"m42t":"Office of Imperial Security Bureau",		"m42s":"You have done a superb job. The more we hamper the actions of the ISB, the closer we come to real freedom in the galaxy.",		"m42o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m42d":"The Imperial Security Bureau's network of civilian spies and informants is a plague on us all. The Alliance places great value on locating and terminating sites of ISB activity. Freedom-loving fighters are encouraged to contact us for the coordinates of such installations. Be aware that the Empire has responded to our campaign by assigning troops to guard these facilities, so expect considerable resistance. May the Force be with you.",		"m41t":"Fuel for Imperial Cloaking Ddevices",		"m41s":"Successes like these are stepping stones to victory over the Empire. May the Force be with you.",		"m41o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m41d":"Cloaking devices create no end of difficulty for Alliance blockade runners. We have tracked a shipment of hybridium ore, essential to modern cloaking systems, from Garos IV to an Imperial transfer point. The site is guarded by Imperial troops, but if we can get a blaster squad inside to level the place, we'll take away the ability of the blockade ships to cloak themselves from our sensors. This will greatly facilitate the movement of our ships through the sector.",		"m40t":"Destroy an Intelligence Office",		"m40s":"Skillfully done. The Alliance values capable agents like you. Contact us again soon.",		"m40o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m40d":"An Imperial spy has wrought havoc on our operations in several sectors. We do not know his identity, but we have discovered the office of Imperial Intelligence to which he reports. If we can destroy his headquarters, we can salvage many operations he has jeopardized. A team of experienced marksmen should be sufficient to knock down this Imperial site and relieve us of many headaches.",		"m39t":"Save Alliance Informants",		"m39s":"We have monitored transmissions within Imperial Intelligence. They are most displeased that you destroyed the list of Alliance informants before they could recover it. You have saved the lives of many good people. May the Force be with you.",		"m39o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m39d":"An Imperial spy is working inside Alliance operations. We know only that he is a Kubaz and he is very good at his work. He has collected a list of Alliance informants and is in the process of transmitting their names to Imperial Intelligence. The list is stored at an Imperial base at the following coordinates. We need a well-armed team to destroy the base before Imperial Intelligence arrives to recover the information. Otherwise many brave Alliance informants will assuredly lose their lives.",		"m38t":"Thwart a Spy",		"m38s":"We have confirmed that the memory droid was destroyed. Our supply routes are safe again. Excellent work!",		"m38o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m38d":"An Imperial spy has infiltrated our supply network. We know only that he is a Kubaz and he is very good at his work. We have a credible suspicion that he has collected dangerous information about our secret shipping routes. A memory droid recently arrived at the Imperial base at the following coordinates. We believe that the droid's databanks contain this secret data. If we are to protect the identities of the depots and freighters that assist us in our cause, we must destroy this base at once. The lives of countless friends of the Alliance are at stake.",		"m37t":"Assist Secret Agent",		"m37s":"Well done. Thanks to your distraction, our secret agent was able to remove the officer who questioned his loyalty to the Empire.",		"m37o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m37d":"The Alliance has placed agents inside many Imperial operations. These brave individuals risk their lives to bring us information concerning the Empire's movements. Sometimes we require direct action to ensure their continued secrecy. Currently one secret operative, well-placed in the Imperial system, is under suspicion by his supervisor. We cannot afford to lose him. Therefore we are commissioning a strike team to attack the small garrison where he is stationed. The diversion will let him eliminate his supervisor and destroy evidence. The action should be loud and messy to provide maximum distraction. Be well-armed and ready for a protracted fight.",		"m36t":"Captured X-wing Fighters",		"m36s":"Well done. All five X-wing fighters were reduced to slag. We must guard every technological advantage if we are to bring the Empire to its knees.",		"m36o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m36d":"The Empire cherishes every opportunity to capture an intact X-wing fighter. InCom's superior X-wing technology, with its heavy armor and hyperdrive, is the envy of the Imperial Navy. To our dismay, recently a civilian informant tipped the Imperial Security Bureau to the location of a hidden cache of fighters. Stormtroopers descended on the place, and now five pristine X-wings are being readied for transport to the Empire's cronies at Sienar Fleet Systems. We cannot allow these ships to depart their landing bay. We need agents in the area to hit the place fast. Make sure nothing is left but smoke and rubble.",		"m35t":"SoroSuub Corporation Shipments",		"m35s":"Allies of the Empire are enemies of freedom. You have done well. Contact us again for the coordinates of more SoroSuub distribution centers.",		"m35o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m35d":"The SoroSuub Corporation, once a peaceful contributor to the economy of the Old Republic, is now a dangerous ally of the Empire. Their ships and weapons are responsible for the deaths of untold numbers of Alliance fighters. To isolate them from distribution contractors, we have begun a campaign to harry shipments of SoroSuub armaments across the galaxy. Here are coordinates for a distribution center on this world. Be aware that the Empire knows of our strategy and often deploys troops to protect these shipments. Prepare for well-armed resistance.",		"m34t":"Lira Wessex Blights Local Region",		"m34s":"Great work! If Lira Wessex was inside that wreck, then you've brought a long, bad career to a belated close. Thank you, and contact us again soon!",		"m34o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m34d":"Informants have brought us dramatic news. Empire ship designer Lira Wessex, who created the original schematics for the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, is apparently visiting this world on a sectorwide tour of shipbuilding facilities. If we can incapacitate Wessex, the Empire will lose one of its greatest talents. Unfortunately, Wessex is here only a while, at an Imperial outpost with a strong escort. Strike fast and strike hard!",		"m33t":"Starship Communication Relays",		"m33s":"This is fine news! We must hope that the Empire's capital ships, with hampered communications, will operate based on inferior strategy. Please check back with us, for we are pleased at your progress!",		"m33o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m33d":"The most sophisticated communication relays in the galaxy, outside Coruscant, sit aboard Imperial capital ships. Our agents within the Imperial bureaucracy have redirected a shipment of these delicate relays, worth a fortune to the Empire, to a supply station here. Though this is hardly a soft target, it's our best chance to destroy a vital component of the Imperial comm apparatus. Move quickly!",		"m32t":"Imperial Astrogation Station",		"m32s":"Great job! Now we'll hope an Imperial ship runs into a meteor shower or asteroid field it couldn't predict. We admire your growing reputation.",		"m32o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m32d":"The astrogation computers on Imperial starships rely on starfield data collected by countless space probes. Probe data for a given planetary neighborhood is collated and encoded at a central astrogation station for relay to Coruscant. If you destroy the astrogation facilities at these coordinates, the Empire must rely on outdated information when travelling in this system. But beware, these stations are always guarded!",		"m31t":"Infestation of Imperial Kitchen Facility",		"m31s":"Great, now we're doing the Imperials' work for them. What a galaxy! But thank you, and be glad we no longer have to fear those oh-so-terrible weft-worms.",		"m31o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m31d":"Get this: An Imperial mess facility got accidentally infested with Sorderian weft-worms. We assume the worms were parasites inside a slave who ducked the Empire's sterilization routines. This would only help us, except that the Empire has decided to solve the infestation by blowing up the entire facility from orbit. Their aim in these matters is not flawless, so we'd actually like you to destroy the facility first. Target practice from a Star Destroyer -- we don't need that!",		"m30t":"Hyperbaride Dump -- Biochem Weapon?",		"m30s":"That's great news! We've had no reports of escape of toxic gases from the site, either. So you've come through for us well, and we'll remember it. Thanks!",		"m30o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m30d":"Production of hyperbaride, which is used for casings of heavy turbolasers, generates highly poisonous byproducts. The Empire usually dumps this stuff on airless moons or into stars, but we've learned of a new cache in this area. We don't know of any current hyperbaride production, so we suspect they're stockpiling this poison as a weapon. The cache is well guarded, but we want it destroyed, preferably in a ball of sterilizing flame.",		"m29t":"DX-343 Solvent Stockpile",		"m29s":"If the Empire had used all that DX-343, we would have been carrying starships out of the hangar in pieces, and their pilots too. Good job taking it out! Please accept our thanks.",		"m29o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m29d":"DX-343 is an industrial solvent that, on exposure into air, disperses into mist. The DX mist disrupts electronic equipment and makes breathing difficult. If our reports are correct, the Empire has stockpiled enough DX-343 at the following coordinates to wipe out three hangars of starfighters and their pilots. Destroy it!",		"m28t":"Niobarium Reagent Facility",		"m28s":"Reports are showing negligible release of niobarium from the destruction. Fine job! Please contact us again for new assignments.",		"m28o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m28d":"The Empire's covert research into planet-wide biochemical weaponry continues. Mass production of these fearsome killers require specialized reagents and catalysts. We have tracked down a facility producing purified niobarium, a poisonous chemical used in one weapons-grade process. To cut off that process, destroy the niobarium plant.",		"m27t":"Imperial Exotic Ammunition",		"m27s":"Well done! It's enough trouble facing blasters and AT-ATs without worrying about those deadly exotics. Your star is on the rise here!",		"m27o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m27d":"We've located an Imperial Army installation housing unusual ammunition: flechette microdart canisters, toxin darts, magna caster quarrels. The installation doubles as quarters for the specialists who maintain this ammo. Expect tough opposition, and stay well clear when you blow up the place.",		"m26t":"Army Weapons Going to Swoop Gangs",		"m26s":"That's one more blow in the fight against gang violence. Good work! We're delighted that you're showing such promise.",		"m26o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m26d":"Maybe you've heard the reports of local swoop gangs with suspiciously good weaponry. We know the Empire's COMPNOR security goons have been arming crooks in communities sympathetic to the Alliance. Now we've found an Imperial Army depot where COMPNOR requisitions the gang weapons. Stop this operation at its source!",		"m25t":"Neuronic Whips",		"m25s":"What a relief! Those neuronic whips would have caused terror far beyond mere crowd control. You're building a good reputation.",		"m25o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m25d":"An Imperial Security outpost here has procured, through illegal back-channels, a shipment of neuronic whips. That's right, slaver weapons, outlawed on every civilized world. They intend to use these brutal stun-whips for crowd control and intimidation. You must destroy the warehouse and the whips. Expect serious opposition, though.",		"m24t":"GTU Powered Armor Components",		"m24s":"Nice job! We hope the Empire will reconsider their GTU deployment in this region.",		"m24o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m24d":"Informants tell us the Empire is shipping in components for their GTU AV-1A Assault Armor. It's a powered combat suit for elite troops, sort of a hovertank you can wear. We've never seen it in action, and we don't want to. If you inflict enough damage to the warehouse, you may set off the explosive charges they use for the suit's ejection system. Then get clear, fast!",		"m23t":"Dola Antibiotic Research",		"m23s":"The dola syrup stolen by the Empire would have saved lives, but your work at least protects the dola trees from Imperial slavery. Thank you!",		"m23o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m23d":"You've heard of the dola trees, the sentient plants of Aruza? No? Their flowers make an antibiotic syrup we use to treat local ailments. We negotiated with the dola for a supply of flowers, but Imperial Intelligence agents stole them and plan to use them to breed a new slave race of dola trees. The flowers are now useless for antibiotics. Destroy them and the Imperial research lab, and stop the plot against the dola trees!",		"m22t":"Imperial Axidite Supplies",		"m22s":"Thank you! That armory stockpile would have gone into dozens of Imperial walkers. Maybe hundreds. Good job!",		"m22o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m22d":"If you've fought on foot against one of those two-leg Imperial scout walkers, you know they're dangerous. We've got word that a local armory is stockpiling the specialized axidite control boxes used in AT-ST command pods. You have a big chance here to interrupt a major Imperial supply chain!",		"m21t":"Restraining Bolt Sabotage Project",		"m21s":"Scratch one more Imperial Intelligence mad-science project. That droid idea might never have worked, but it doesn't hurt that you made sure. Thanks!",		"m21o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m21d":"If it scares you to think of a harmless protocol droid stabbing you in your sleep, listen to this. Imperial Intelligence is working on high-frequency broadcasts that burn out a droid's restraining bolts and ruin its programming. Basically a droid gets this signal and goes berserk. Of course, any grownup can handle a rogue 3PO unit, but what about the children? Stop this weird-science research before it's too late.",		"m20t":"Thermal Detonator Warehouse",		"m20s":"You did it! It's a relief to know those detonators won't be troubling the locals. The reward's yours!",		"m20o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m20d":"To get what it wants, the Empire has made plenty of covert deals with criminals. Right now it wants money, and so it's shipping thermal detonators to local gangsters. Whether they're set off by Imperials or crooks, these bombs always end up destroying innocent citizens' property. If you can blow up the detonator warehouse, and its heavy defenses, you'll be doing this planet a big favor.",		"m19t":"Protector Droid Engineering Compound",		"m19s":"Thank you! Facing an improved Protector droid would not have been fun, to say the least. You are progessing well!",		"m19o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m19d":"Imperial forces are guarding -- perhaps a better word is "confining" -- engineers working for Baktoid Combat Automata. In this compound these engineers are stress-testing blaster subsystems for a redesigned Protector-series combat droid. Destroy the engineering compound and the Protector plans.",		"m18t":"Durindfire Gem Holding Facility",		"m18s":"Durindfire gems flash brilliantly, but in Imperial hands they're covered with blood. It's better that you destroyed them. Good work!",		"m18o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m18d":"The Empire is relaying a cache of rare durindfire gems, under heavy guard, to a merchant in this area. You may know that Imperials traffic in these gems to finance their more exotic projects, such as the Death Star. If you can destroy these gems in their holding facility, you'll strike a blow against covert financiers across the galaxy.",		"m17t":"Byrothsis Purification Facility",		"m17s":"Excellent job. With their infrared lenses going cloudy, Imperial TIE fighters might be slower to see our ships. Let's hope!",		"m17o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m17d":"The Empire's infrared camera lenses require the rare mineral byrothsis. These lenses require frequent specialized maintenance, and one of the maintenance facilities is nearby. By destroying the byrothsis purification facility, your team can put the Empire in the dark. Good luck!",		"m16t":"Empire Gunnery School",		"m16s":"Excellent work! The Alliance has nothing against education, but we don't like what the Empire does with it. We look forward to working with you again!",		"m16o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m16d":"We have identified an Imperial fortified complex as a gunnery school for local recruits. Today they're firing at target droids, but tomorrow they'll be aiming at us. You have to destroy that compound -- today!",		"m15t":"Imperial Diplomatic Garrison",		"m15s":"Fast work! It's not often we take out an Imperial garrison, even if it is just a diplomatic garrison. Actually, only the first part of one. Never mind, you deserve your reward!",		"m15o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m15d":"The Empire has deployed a prefab structure in an outlying area. It appears to be an early beachhead for a diplomatic garrison. No one here knows what a diplomat would have to be diplomatic about, way out there. In any case, it is essential to destroy it before the Empire can fortify it.",		"m14t":"Rescue Mouse Droid",		"m14s":"Excellent "rescue!" If we can get those Imperial slugs to start worrying about their MSE-6 droids, then we've already won this war. Keep it up.",		"m14o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m14d":"Reports have been coming in about that amazing little MSE-6 droid. If Imperial Intelligence reports are to be believed, that tiny dynamo has blasted its way past blockades, commandeered vessels, and led those Imperial slugs on a wild mynock chase. All this paints a very amusing picture of the Empire's overall effectiveness. We want to help spread these rumors. We've planted a false Imperial report on the HoloNet that claims the Empire has captured the small troublemaker, which is being held at a detention facility awaiting interrogation by Imperial Inquisitors. We need a team of operatives to strike this detention facility and make it seem as if the MSE-6 droid was "rescued" by the Alliance. Can you help us embarrass the Empire further?",		"m13t":"Imperial Transceivers",		"m13s":"It's obvious you know the meaning of success, citizen. Job well done! Even if we didn't get the prototype, its destruction is a good consolation prize.",		"m13o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m13d":"The Empire has designed an improved subspace transceiver. The working prototype was sent to a manufacturing facility for mass production. A small team of operatives must make sure those transceivers are never built and either secure or destroy the prototype. We'll transmit the coordinates when we have your acceptance.",		"m12t":"Orbital Mines",		"m12s":"Good work, citizen! Those mines won't be claiming the lives of our pilots and crew members. We look forward to working with you again.",		"m12o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m12d":"A large shipment of orbital mines is to be delivered to the Star Destroyer Avenger soon. The dispersal of these mines would make life much more difficult for our fleet, as you can imagine. We've discovered these mines and need the depot blasted into oblivion. The coordinates will be sent when you accept the mission. May the Force be with you. ",		"m11t":"Turbolaser Actuators",		"m11s":"Well struck, agent. Without their turbolasers, those hulking capital ships are just so much space debris. May the Force be with you.",		"m11o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m11d":"We've discovered a shipment of turbolaser actuators, currently stored in an Imperial depot and scheduled to be delivered to the Kuat Drive Yards. We must make sure those actuators are never installed in any capital ship's weapons. A team of skilled agents should be able to blast this depot off without much trouble. You'll have to work fast, though.",		"m10t":"Poke Out the Empire's Eyes",		"m10s":"Good going! Fewer probe droids means fewer chances to find our bases. The Empire can't destroy what they can't find, after all. You're becoming a very promising agent indeed.",		"m10o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m10d":"A cargo of probe droids has just been delivered to a supply depot servicing this sector. A Star Destroyer is scheduled to enter the system's orbit sometime in the next few days and those probe droids will be transported aboard. We don't need to tell you how much damage those probe droids can cause to the Alliance. We need a skilled agent to take out that supply depot and make sure those probe droids are destroyed.",		"m9t":"Illegal Drugs",		"m9s":"Good! Not only have you disposed of a great deal of illegal drugs, you've cost Imperial Intelligence millions of credits worth of bribe money. Let's see how eager they are to bribe the CSA now that they have to dig into their own budget. This is a great victory for the Alliance, friend.",		"m9o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m9d":"An small Imperial outpost is currently being used to store of seized glitterstim spice. This cargo is intended to bribe Corporate Sector Authority officials to comply with Imperial Intelligence's requests to access confidential corporate records. The Alliance needs a few good individuals to make sure that outpost is destroyed and everything inside it is burned to the ground. No spice, no favors from the CSA. The outpost will be well guarded. After all, there's a whole lot of spice in there. ",		"m8t":"HoloNet Data Station",		"m8s":"Bravo! Cut off the head and the body cannot survive for long. Your efforts to interrupt Imperial Intelligence's communication to the rest of the Empire's war machine will be instrumental in our eventual success. Your reward is well earned.",		"m8o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m8d":"The Alliance has acquired the coordinates to an Imperial HoloNet data collection station. This station is used by Imperial Intelligence's Analysis Bureau to coordinate surveillance efforts for the entire sector. If we take out this station, we effectively cripple Imperial Intelligence's ability to uncover our sabotage missions and raids of Imperial depots. This would be a great victory for the Alliance. Can you lead such a strike?",		"m7t":"Imperial Records",		"m7s":"Excellent! The best thing about the Empire's ponderous bureaucracy is that it's easy to throw a hydrospanner into the works. Good job! Claim your reward and may the Force be with you.",		"m7o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m7d":"An Imperial Academy processing center is currently housing the results of several hundred potential pilots' flight exams. If those scores are destroyed, this will create a severe backlog for the Imperial bureaucracy and slow the aggressive recruitment efforts of the Imperial Navy. Further, it would let us approach potential recruits and possibly enlist their aid against the Empire. Do you wish to lead this important mission?",		"m6t":"Sienar Warehouse",		"m6s":"The distinctive roar of those TIE engines is greatly diminished today. Great job, agent. We knew we could count on you.",		"m6o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m6d":"We've located a Sienar Fleet Systems warehouse and have learned that it's currently storing ion engines scheduled to go to Imperial shipyards in this sector. That will mean more TIE fighters for our X-wing pilots to deal with. We need someone to destroy that warehouse and everything inside.",		"m5t":"ISB Interrogation Compound",		"m5s":"Bravo, agent! Now citizens will realize that the power of the ISB is not absolute and that the Empire is fallible. You've earned your reward.",		"m5o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m5d":"Our informants have identified an ISB compound used for interrogations. If the stories can be believed, terrible atrocities have taken place. Destroying this foul place would send the right message to both the Empire and to citizens who lived in fear of Imperial Security. We're looking for a dedicated agent who can lead a successful assault on this nightmarish compound. Are you that agent? ",		"m4t":"Power Droid Plant",		"m4s":"No power means no weapons or defenses. Our congratulations on the success of your mission. Keep up the good work. The Alliance is counting on you.",		"m4o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m4d":"We've located a major Imperial power droid manufacturing plant. Taking this plant out would be more than a simple inconvenience for the Empire. Their Star Destroyers and garrisons rely on these power droids to keep battle stations running. It will take a strong, precise strike to cripple this installation. The Alliance needs your help.  ",		"m3t":"Weapons Development Lab",		"m3s":"Bravo! No new blasters for those scout troopers! An impressive bit of work, agent. The Alliance thrives because of individuals like you. May the Force be with you.",		"m3o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m3d":"A small SoroSuub weapons testing facility must be knocked out. We believe they are working on an improved design for the scout trooper blaster that would greatly increase its firepower and accuracy. The Alliance can't afford to have scout troopers get better sidearms. We don't know what kind of security this facility will have, but we imagine it'll be formidable. You might need help.",		"m2t":"Local Rebel Repair Station",		"m2s":"Broken down speeder bikes don't do the Empire any good. Job well done, agent. The Alliance could use more fighters like you.",		"m2o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m2d":"A transport repair station at these coordinates services Imperial scout troopers' speeder bikes. If this facility were destroyed, it would limit the number of Imperial search-and-destroy missions for this entire system. Can we count on you to orchestrate this strike? As always, the Alliance will reward you for services rendered.",		"m1t":"Local Rebel Refueling Depot",		"m1s":"Now that's how it's done! Those Imperial patrols will stay grounded for a while. Long live the Alliance!",		"m1o":"The Alliance to Restore the Republic",		"m1d":"Local Imperial patrols have been relying on a refueling depot not far from here. The depot's destruction would certainly hamper the Empire's ability to effectively search for our cells. The Empire realizes this, so the depot is likely to be well defended. This mission will require skill and fortitude. Can the Alliance depend on you to lead such a strike?"
