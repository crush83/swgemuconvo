Looking for a fight? Not today, chump, but definitely some other time.",		"s_cdc241bf":"Well then it doesn't look like you are going to be returning to your good friend with this here ring.  Unless...",		"s_cd72f93":"Good choice.",		"s_860ae378":"Actually, I've given Keicho enough options.

You mean this ring? The one I took from Keicho? The one he balked on when it came time to place a bet. I won his landspeeder last week, and his wifes wedding gown the week before that.

I love that gown. But he wouldn't bet the ring.
