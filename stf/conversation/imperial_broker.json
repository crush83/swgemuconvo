		"s_fda95628":"Yes, ma'am!  How may I be of assistance?",		"s_fbeabc76":"If that's what you want, I'll start getting your discharge papers together. If you want to change your mind, now is the time.",		"s_fb390611":"Do you need directions or something, dear?  The bazaar terminals are near the starport.",		"s_f72f24be":"I want to retire.",		"s_f5f50ae3":"Of course.  My mistake.",		"s_f220efed":"I changed my mind. I will stay.",		"s_f05830e3":"There's not much more I can say, sir, but I will add the location to your datapad.  Talk to the Imperial Pilot trainer in Kadaara.  You'll find the association hall in the main plaza.",		"s_ed23ffff":"Are you interested in either Black Epsilon or the Storm Squadron, sir?",		"s_e8ccc35c":"You've made the right choice, pilot. Dismissed.",		"s_e60ef8f6":"Hello, pilot. I hope that your service in the Imperial Navy treats you well. How may I be of assistance?",		"s_e2dae58f":"You have no business with me. Be on your way.",		"s_e0db13e8":"Storm Squadron is one of the Empire's finest military units, in space or otherwise.  They're the very model of the sort of hard-core, dedicated, soldiers that secure the Empire throughout the galaxy.",		"s_df2917b1":"Tell me more",		"s_d78c7ec0":"Ma'am!  Yes, ma'am!  Are you here to sign-up?",		"s_d28bda49":"Would you be interested in either Black Epsilon or the Storm Squadron, ma'am?",		"s_d1c489c0":"In that case, please stop bothering me.  I am very busy.",		"s_cd41504a":"Yes, ma'am.  I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add this location to your datapad.  Talk to the trainer in the Bestine Pilot's Club, near the capitol building on Tatooine.",		"s_ccdbfea7":"Very well. You are now discharged from the Imperial Navy. I must say that I am disappointed. I expected better from you.",		"s_cc37bca4":"Yes, sir.  I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of their own recruiter to your datapad.  If you'll speak with this officer in the Imperial Base on Talus, he will get you squared away.",		"s_c2c89e35":"Yes, ma'am.  Black Epsilon is stationed at the Imperial Base on Talus, as Corellia itself is officially neutral... for now.  There are reports of considerable Rebel activity in the area, as you can imagine.  They could really use more pilots there, ma'am.",		"s_be46803":"I don't think I can help you, citizen. You don't look like much of a pilot.",		"s_b945b46a":"Yes, ma'am.  I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of their own recruiter to your datapad.  If you'll speak with this officer in the Imperial Base on Talus, he will get you squared away.",		"s_b89f31b":"Imperial Inquisition is a special unit located in the Naboo system, ma'am.  They tend to deal in highly classified missions, so I'm afraid there's not a lot I'm authorized to tell you.",		"s_b8884586":"I'm authorized to send you to one of three assignments, ma'am.  You can choose Storm Squadron in the Tatooine system, Black Epsilon in the Corellia system, or the Imperial Inquisition in the Naboo system.",		"s_b845eeb6":"Get lost!",		"s_b19ac578":"HAHAHAHAHA!  Imagine that!  A big fur-ball like you flying a ship for the Empire!  Oh that is RICH!",		"s_b0ea6e8c":"Yes.  What do I need to do?",		"s_ac926b4b":"Was there something else, ma'am?",		"s_a8b71650":"Yes, sir.  What about Black Epsilon or the Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_a7d90105":"Very well, sir.  What about Storm Squadron or the Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_9f862c74":"What about Storm Squadron or the Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_99e09eaf":"Ma'am, you wouldn't last one nano-second as an Imperial pilot.  It's a strenuous, demanding profession that requires the utmost dedication.  Not to mention the fact that females are notoriously bad pilots!  Now if you will excuse me, good day!",		"s_929272e8":"Imperial Inquisition is a special unit located in the Naboo system, sir.  They tend to deal in highly classified missions, so I'm afraid there's not a lot I'm authorized to tell you.",		"s_8ed93c34":"No, just checking.",		"s_8d91ee22":"Was there something else, sir?",		"s_8c387e5c":"Sir! Yes, sir!  Are you here to sign-up?",		"s_8ac37a1f":"There's not much more I can say, ma'am, but I will add this location to your datapad.  Talk to the Pilot Trainer in the association hall on Kadaara, near the main plaza.",		"s_895d093":"Ok.",		"s_8812be10":"I would like to retire from the Imperial Navy.",		"s_8755e6eb":"Very well, sir.  Please come see me if you change your mind.  The Empire could use more soldiers of your caliber in space!",		"s_86cb9899":"Yes.  Black Epsilon is stationed at the Imperial Base on Talus, as Corellia itself is officially neutral... for now.  There are reports of considerable Rebel activity in the area.",		"s_840482e7":"Nothing",		"s_83a7ae89":"Very well, ma'am.  Please come see me if you change your mind.  The Empire could use more soldiers of your caliber in space!",		"s_772c81dd":"Yes, sir.  Black Epsilon is stationed at the Imperial Base on Talus, as Corellia itself is officially neutral... for now.  There are reports of considerable Rebel activity in the area, as you can imagine.  They could really use more pilots there, sir.",		"s_7287c2b7":"I won't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of the Storm Squadron pilot trainer to your datapad.  You'll find him in the Bestine Pilot's club on Tatooine, next to the capitol building.",		"s_727cf8b6":"What about Black Epsilon or the Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_70f18874":"I'm not interested in that.",		"s_6e2d55ee":"HAHAHAHA!",		"s_6a1562ad":"What do you want?",		"s_658b5a75":"Yes, I want to retire.",		"s_6441a2a6":"As you wish.",		"s_61a663b2":"I want to be an Imperial Pilot",		"s_59be173":"Can I help you?",		"s_5817eef2":"Yes, sir.  I can't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of the Storm Squadron commander to your datapad.  He'll be glad to have a soldier of your standing.  You can find him in the Bestine Pilot's Club next to the capitol building on Tatooine.",		"s_4cafd748":"Storm Squadron?",		"s_4b0c16d2":"Are you recruiting Imperial Pilots?",		"s_458bda80":"Did I hear you correctly? You want to retire? You are aware that you would lose all your pilot skills, and your mission records would be deleted. If you sign up again, you will start as a new recruit. Are you sure this is what you want to do?",		"s_4577214d":"I'm authorized to send you to one of three assignments, sir.  You can choose Storm Squadron in the Tatooine system, Black Epsilon in the Corellia system, or the Imperial Inquisition in the Naboo system.",		"s_445a2be4":"No. Never mind.",		"s_42693321":"I see.  What about Black Epsilon or the Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_407fb5e3":"Very well, ma'am.  What about Storm Squadron or the Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_3d734747":"I won't release any specific details about their current engagements, but I will add the location of their recruiting officer to your datapad.  You can find him in the Imperial Base on Talus, in the Corellia system.",		"s_3c9c6441":"Imperial Inquisition is a special unit located in the Naboo system.  Their mission is highly classified.",		"s_3bbddad5":"Sir, I don't intend any disrespect, but the Imperial Pilots are the finest in the Galaxy.  You don't look like the sort of person who could last one week in the cadet academy, let alone pilot any sort of Imperial craft.  Now I think you should leave.  I am very busy.",		"s_2fe6ab5f":"Highly.  Classified.  Right?  I will add the location of the unit's pilot trainer to your datapad.  You may speak to him in the main plaza association hall in Kadaara, on Naboo.",		"s_2eee3e2e":"Yes, sir!  How may I be of assistance?",		"s_2a4c66e4":"Come see me if you change your mind.  Someone has to stand up to the Rebel Alliance and maintain order in the galaxy.",		"s_23ef3e33":"Imperial Inquisition?",		"s_1b2086de":"Black Epsilon?",		"s_169df3bb":"Never mind.",		"s_14270b3":"Are you here to sign-up?",		"s_13a23fbc":"Tell me what you can",		"s_106caa1d":"The units with vacancies currently are the Storm Squadron in the Tatooine system, Black Epsilon in the Corellia system, or the Imperial Inquisition in the Naboo system.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (imperial_broker.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
