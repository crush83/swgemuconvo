		"s_da7cd509":"Yes...Sir.",		"s_8bc64ef3":"Genocide is not my thing doctor. I think our work here is done.",		"s_86216dc2":"What?! They're vermin! If you leave any of them alive, they will breed and spread like the rodents they are. I will make sure to report your insolence to your commanding officer! Now where were those escape pods..",		"s_855a26e7":"Well you have to take care of them then soldier! They are not worth more than a womp rat but twice as annoying. Cleanse this ship of their filthy presence!",		"s_7dbf5a70":"No, they are all taken care of.",		"s_715b64d7":"Good work soldier. I'd hate to see all my ground-breaking work fall in to the hands of these Rebel scum. I will make my way to one of the escape pods now. I will also make sure to let your commanding officer know how well you took care of the vermin on this ship.",		"s_5b99b059":"Finally, took you long enough! For a while there I actually thought these stinking traitors would take me to where ever they were heading. Did you leave any of them alive?",		"s_5128536b":"There might be some around still.",		"s_339b706e":"Pardon me, and don't think me rude... afterall I am dutifully thankful for your part in my escape... but I should think it necessary to effect the completion of that escape rather than stand around talking like new recruits at an Imperial gala.",		"s_2a121860":"Good! I will make my way to the escape pods. Great work here soldier, I will make sure your commanding officer hears about it.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (corvette_bledsoe_imperial_rescue_target.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
