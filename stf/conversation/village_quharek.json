		"s_faf1fbe4":"You there! Are you handy with a set of tools? Eh... looks like you're too busy to help me anyway. Nevermind.",		"s_fae10418":"What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here!",		"s_f474ed78":"Not really no.",		"s_f1a421d":"Say, I know you. They tell me you've been a great help. Good job.",		"s_ebabb0f8":"You there! Are you handy with a set of tools?",		"s_e26f0607":"Of course you understand that this job will take a while, and if you agree to fix this thing, you won't be able to help anyone else with anything for a while, right?",		"s_e05cc4d4":"What's going on here? I'm all confused! I don't know what's going on!",		"s_c9f1dbdc":"That doesn't sound like something that I can do.",		"s_be3bc184":"Hey! You got that all fixed up, didn't you? And just in time. You're all right, you know that?",		"s_b2dd509a":"Great. Our sensor array was damaged in the last attack on this village by the Sith Shadows.

If you find someone who can... send 'em over.",		"s_8abf86da":"You want me to take a look at the sensor array?",		"s_8459377a":"Yes, I will go repair the sensor array.",		"s_75cdc0ad":"On second thought, I don't think that I can help you.",		"s_6a934b47":"Master... I must find the master.",		"s_5ec4a1e":"Alright, well if you see someone who is... send 'em over.",		"s_52acc0":"That's a shame. If you find someone who will... send 'em over.",		"s_4beb938f":"Yes, I suppose I am.",		"s_27808b0b":"Good show! If you help us out with this, I will help you learn to use the Force to enhance your assembly skills.",		"s_1b7f8e6d":"Good! You'd better get to work then. The sooner we get that thing back online, the better!",		"s_16cc0ae1":"What are you waiting for?
