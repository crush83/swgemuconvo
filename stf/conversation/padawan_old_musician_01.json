		"s_f6fe45ba":"Well hello... oh you're back. Did you find any of my old friends?",		"s_f2a197da":"Have you found my old friends?",		"s_ef7a7d43":"My friends may all have passed on, but this ring will help me remember. Thank you.",		"s_e4475a83":"Looks like you are out of luck old man.",		"s_dbc1ba26":"Well hello there!  It's always nice to see new faces at this age.  Reminds me of years past.

Humor and old man for a bit, and listen up eh?",		"s_d7ea1106":"Also there's a rin... er... I mean... yeah, I'll be going.",		"s_d7278b9f":"Sort of, but there's no way I'm travelling all the way to Lok",		"s_d6d1e61d":"You don't even have to say it friend, I can see from the look in your eyes.

They are all dead.

You can go on now, thanks again for your help.",		"s_d27dbab":"In my younger years I was in a traveling band.  We played all over this here planet.  We were not the best band around, but people seemed to enjoy our music enough.

Over the years the band drifted and we all went our separate ways.  I haven't kept in touch with any of the three other members, and have regretted it to this day.",		"s_d23b54d0":"You're not even gonna live long enough for this to be worth it. I'm out.",		"s_c53fc924":"No, but I found a good lead. One of your friends moved to Lok.",		"s_c4a1af2c":"Not yet, but I'm still looking. I'll be back when I find them.",		"s_c2f4a95c":"Any reason you cannot look for them yourself?",		"s_a80877a1":"I look forward to hearing from you.",		"s_9fe9d850":"Oh, that is very good news. Please go and find out if he's still there.",		"s_7a8dee0a":"Back when I used to play my music, I wore a blumfruit on my lapel because it was the style at the time.",		"s_73519ce0":"Are they on their way?",		"s_6b726d18":"Truthfully, I don't have much time left.  I think it would be a surprise to both my doctors and myself if I made it to the end of this week.",		"s_6aa99fbc":"You are a quick one.  All I want is for you to try to find them.  If you could of course.",		"s_64234023":"This was given to me... to give to you.",		"s_6386bdac":"What's that? Speak up a bit. Where ya going...",		"s_52917b0d":"Of course.",		"s_5027198":"That's a good question. I think there's a man I used to know... he's a booking agent for musical acts. Name's Marco Vahn.

Last I heard, he was in Mos Eisley on Tatooine trying to convince some band at the cantina there to go on tour for him. He might know where my old band mates are.",		"s_4f05c224":"I don't have time for your dusty old stories.",		"s_431c1c58":"I've got some bad news Grizzlo.",		"s_42d4547":"Lok? Why would you go there? Oh never mind. I'm surprised you've done as much as you have, to be honest.",		"s_2d9fa396":"If only you'd found at least one of them alive. I would have gone to my rest a happier man.",		"s_2d855cc6":"Samston always did like to rub it in.  We would fight for days over Selestina, she was the sole reason 'The Blue Mead', broke up.

This ring means a whole lot to me, and I appreciate the trouble you went through to get it.  I wish I hadn't been so stubborn in my life and I hope you can learn from my poor example.",		"s_2c577f48":"Where should I start?",		"s_246ed1c7":"Don't much have to tell me that.  Lady luck left me many years ago.  

Thanks for your time.",		"s_189e6456":"As I thought.  I didn't much expect you to.",		"s_150fa11a":"My guess is you want me to help you with that.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (padawan_old_musician_01.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
