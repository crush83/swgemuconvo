Get out of my sight.",		"s_dfffcfb":"Why do the dirty work of a politician when I can do it for you? Let me take that disk off your hands. In fact, I know I may have something with which I can pay you for your... generosity.",		"s_7b45b993":"Get lost. I have no business to conduct with you. Too many people in arms about the Sand People attacking Bestine. It'll be easy for me, I can just leave just as easily as I've come. Go away. I have things to do, people to bribe.",		"s_70142360":"Why wouldn't I? It contains pertinent information regarding a highly-regarded politician and I'm one of Jabba's informants. Again, I ask... why wouldn't I want it?",		"s_54b54bd0":"Here take it. Give me my payment.",		"s_53f349b7":"Oh and don't blame me if you can't use this thing. It was all I had on me. Go sell it or something. You didn't deserve that great of a reward. It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Good day.",		"s_4ddc07ed":"I won't give it to you.",		"s_139f41b9":"Why do you want the disk?",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (hutt_informant.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
