		"s_ffd5b6f7":"Hmm. You may have what it takes to be a combat pilot. On the other hand, you might have just gotten lucky. Either way, you fulfilled your duty. Here is your payment and an additional sum to compensate for hazards encountered.",		"s_fdbe01c2":"Report in with me when you've completed the operation.",		"s_fd8bce2a":"A mission, pilot? Don't overstep your station. You're a voluntary conscript, not a combat pilot. If you're lucky, the Empire might one day see fit to post you to combat duty.",		"s_fd4fe208":"That is your choice, but you may not get this chance again.  I suggest that you take it while you can.",		"s_fcf4d778":"How?",		"s_fcb1448e":"I hope you reconsider. You have the right kind of attitude and character. If you decide you'd like to fly for us, you know where to find me. Good day, citizen.",		"s_fa0ab23c":"By the powers vested in me by the Imperial Naval Command, under the ever watchful eye of the Emperor, I hereby commend you and bestow upon you the rank of Pilot Officer. Congratulations, Pilot Officer.",		"s_f91b288f":"Very well. I'll fly it again.",		"s_f7913cae":"At ease, Pilot. The security situation in the Bestine Orbital Region has clearly deteriorated. Pirate attacks on commerce lanes and supply transports cannot be tolerated. You have shown commendable initiative in responding to pirate aggression, so you have been selected for a special mission.",		"s_f4fa11bb":"Hmm. Nope, don't know the guy.",		"s_f4d10868":"Report to me when you have completed your mission to claim your bounty.",		"s_f43f3569":"I'm ready for training",		"s_f3852d77":"They have underestimated my ability.",		"s_f195b141":"Yes, I know",		"s_f1471b6a":"As well you should not. You will be given assignments that, while small, are still critical to Imperial interests in the Outer Rim. The consequences of failure would be significant.  So, as you say, you will not fail.",		"s_eee17bb3":"I seek to serve the Empire.",		"s_ee91723f":"(Relate the facts on the commerce raider attack.)",		"s_ee657693":"Service in the Imperial Navy isn't something to be taken lightly. Your training will be strict, you'll be expected to follow orders, and of course, any association with the Rebellion would be punished severely. Are you sure you want to sign up?",		"s_ee63dfa9":"Report back to me when you would like a new duty or mission.",		"s_eb1ee299":"Why don't you run missions for the ground-pounders until you've got better faction standing?  Until then, don't talk to me.  You brought this on yourself.",		"s_ea5b6641":"I have to admit that you have the makings of a true Imperial officer about you. Report back to me when you are ready for your next mission.",		"s_e95fb13d":"If you perform capably, we will consider you for more dangerous assignments. Good luck.",		"s_e92da88":"Sure, sign me up. I like making you squirm.",		"s_e87a40f8":"I'd rather not right now.",		"s_e814cf37":"I would like a duty mission.",		"s_e4e8b551":"There seems to be no end to these petty duties.",		"s_e4e336cc":"Report to me upon completion of the mission.",		"s_e1da893f":"I'm fairly busy, so I'll have to talk to you later.",		"s_e12b6418":"I located and destroyed him, sir.",		"s_e106780b":"Good to see you, Pilot.",		"s_dfd0987b":"You don't take complements very well. This one was worth double the normal rate. I've also received your Imperial TIE pilot helmet, specifically calibrated for your mental and physical flight profile.",		"s_df76b2e8":"Imperial astromech functionality is typically built into a rugged navicomputer, rather than those annoying sorts of astromech units that the Rebel Alliance relies on.  I can teach you how to utilize some of the basic functionality of the droid interface to normalize your shields, overload your weapons, and that sort of thing.",		"s_df69a100":"If you don't get yourself killed first. Now that you have achieved an official command rank, I am no longer your commanding officer. You have been reassigned. Commander Oberhaur of the ISD Accuser will handle your assignments from this point on.",		"s_de76730a":"Where is my new assignment?",		"s_dd40f86b":"As do we all. Now that you have achieved an official command rank, I am no longer your commanding officer. Although it pains me to lose such a fine pilot, you have been reassigned pending approval of transfer.",		"s_dc63dc1a":"Never mind, I don't want any training after all.",		"s_dae6651c":"Pirates?  Tatooine is known for criminal activity, but Bestine has always been strongly protected by Imperial justice.  The recent Rebel insurgency must be giving the pirates a new spirit of confidence.",		"s_da07fb7a":"I would prefer a posting to Special Operations.",		"s_d9d4feec":"Will you train me, now?",		"s_d92fcf8d":"(Relate how you purged several Imperial enemies.)",		"s_d90e49c9":"Ah, yes, well, the Imperial Navy is the finest fleet in the galaxy. We command the Empire's starships and fighters. We are the hammer of Imperial justice. All members of the Imperial Navy are officers, however we are now starting to recruit non-officer pilots for limited support duty.",		"s_d8a302bc":"All who oppose me are destined to fail.",		"s_d8487693":"Pilot. I don't have any specific work for you at this time. You can now select your preferred operation from a list of general duties. Or, if you have enough experience, pursue training.",		"s_d825aeb0":"Very well, good day Pilot.",		"s_d788f447":"Pirates? Tatooine is known for criminal activity, but Bestine has always been strongly protected by Imperial justice. The recent Rebel insurgency must be giving the pirates a new spirit of confidence.",		"s_d7816410":"Look, I've got people to pay. Do you have work for me or not?",		"s_d51ef84a":"(Give a mocking salute.)",		"s_d4dd5a28":"There was a...",		"s_d422a73d":"Your attitude is poor and I can tell by your dress that you are nothing more than petty scum. I don't like you, but then I suppose that I don't have to like you. I need to hire volunteers for limited military service. If you really can fly and shoot, we might have something for you.",		"s_d25c510b":"Duty missions are open ended assignments. They end when you choose to end them. For example, if I assign you the task of hunting pirates, you can hunt as many pirates as you want. You can end the duty any time from the mission entry in your datapad. Perform duties to earn pay and build experience. Once you've received enough experience, I can instruct you on various aspects of the pilot's combat role.",		"s_d25495b9":"Pilot, I am singularly impressed. You have mastered the fundamentals of your profession and have performed beyond expectation and all without formal Imperial Naval Flight & Command training. I think it's time for a promotion.",		"s_d09c1ecb":"Just doing my duty, sir.",		"s_d07b11b5":"(Glower at him, disapprovingly.)",		"s_ce681825":"You should have realized this long ago.",		"s_cdbce743":"I want to enlist in the ground forces.",		"s_cd024d84":"It looks intimidating. I like it.",		"s_cbfb3200":"Only the will of the Emperor delivers true justice...",		"s_cb99174":"I have to study what went wrong.",		"s_ca3578cc":"I think it suits you. You have exceeded the expectations of this program and of myself. Your duty has not ended, however. Return when you are ready to take on another operation.",		"s_c9d11db3":"You might come to regret it. I've convinced the Naval Command to test your abilities further. We want to crush the pirates and demonstrate that Imperial resolve remains strong. I want you to get into space and destroy any Commerce Raiders you find. Your mission is to eliminate four of the pirates.",		"s_c6d9f61":"I'd like to study that in detail.",		"s_c6aae4cb":"Cranial proportions?",		"s_c48451bf":"I don't expect you will run into trouble, as many ships safely move through the region every day, but be on guard. If you do encounter something amiss, you have permission to respond as you see fit. This operational autonomy is contingent upon your continued success.  Screw up and you'll be kept on a short leash.",		"s_c3e56b53":"Perhaps.",		"s_c2ef0b45":"Pilot. You've managed to achieve some level of success, but you are still relatively inexperienced. I have been authorized to give you special instruction in an area of your choosing.",		"s_c19ed115":"You've got your assignment, and the control device for your ship in your datapad.  Go to the Starport and access the terminal to launch into space.",		"s_c16743ff":"Service Pilot Initiate stand at attention!",		"s_c124ad4f":"Sir, I can fly. It would be an honor to fly with the Imperial Navy.",		"s_c0ce49d6":"(Grunt in affirmation.)",		"s_c0c8fe59":"One day the Emperor himself will recognize my strength.",		"s_c08929f2":"Consider them dead, sir.",		"s_c01da9e4":"(Sneer at him.) Just pay me.",		"s_bf64734d":"I don't want to learn anything right now.",		"s_bc7382d4":"'We are but a tool to achieve that end.' I, too, know the text of the Imperial Doctrine. It's an element of core officer training. Although many members of the Imperial Navy are adherents to the doctrine, we are ultimately a military organization. Politics and theology are the realm of the bureaucrats.",		"s_bc695163":"I can clear you for a new TIE Fighter, but only the basic model. Are you sure you want a new control device?",		"s_bc6327c0":"I don't like working with bounty hunters like you. For a soldier, killing is a necessary evil. You seem to get some kind of thrill from it.",		"s_bc1c993d":"I am. I would be honored to hunt the enemies of the Empire.",		"s_bb6caa54":"You can learn about Imperial technology, weapons, standard Imperial training, or astromech management.",		"s_bb4e17d0":"No doubt you did, as would be expected from any Imperial pilot. Here is your salary as well as a little extra. The Emperor rewards dutiful service. I've taken liberty of submitting your physical profile to the Commissions Office. Your spec TIE flight suit will be ready soon.",		"s_b9b88c88":"I see success in your future, Initiate. You appear to be capable of things the average conscript is not. Report to me when you are ready for further duties.",		"s_b9173bca":"I've already received word of your success against Commerce Raiders in the region. It seems the Empire was not at error to place its trust in you.",		"s_b8f011dc":"Here is your salary for the mission. This one was worth double the normal rate. I've also received your Imperial TIE pilot helmet, specifically calibrated for your mental and physical flight profile. Wear this whenever you are on duty as a symbol of the Empire's technological and military might.",		"s_b8ca7ab0":"As long as you keep paying, I'll keep delivering.",		"s_b7c14c03":"Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Akal Colzet, Imperial Navy. I've been assigned to Tatooine to recruit local volunteer pilots into service. Are you interested in learning about the Imperial Navy?",		"s_b737f77e":"I have other things to attend to, good day.",		"s_b5d0e16a":"This information will please the Naval Command. No doubt they will also realize that part of your success came from my masterful instruction. I think you may have done us both a great service.",		"s_b3e4cc19":"Ahem. You appear to be capable of things the average conscript is not. Report to me when you are ready for further duties.",		"s_b3753189":"I was able to eliminate all of the pirates who attacked, sir.",		"s_b36213b9":"It never changes with you does it. Here's your payment as well as a bonus for saving the transport. I also received your Imperial flight suit, but I'm not going to give it to you... you'd be an embarrassment to the Empire.  Just take this bandolier.  At least you can keep your things organized, for a change.",		"s_b3408be1":"Are you ready for your first assignment?",		"s_b2b35c1f":"Special, eh? Hope that means it pays more money.",		"s_b2995db3":"(Growl at him.)",		"s_b1f99085":"This information will please the Naval Command. You have done an impressive job, Pilot. Perhaps you really are all that you claim.",		"s_b0b9044d":"So it would seem. Naval Command would like to test your abilities further. We want to crush the pirates and demonstrate that Imperial resolve remains strong. I want you to get into space and destroy any Commerce Raiders you find. Your mission is to eliminate four of the pirates.",		"s_ae6ab110":"Glad I could bring a little spice to your life.",		"s_adf9eee2":"Report to me when you've completed your mission.",		"s_aceff31e":"Good luck, pilot.",		"s_abffcfd7":"Pirate activity is still high enough that we need combat capable pilots on active duty locating and eliminating them. You have free reign to use lethal force against any commerce raiders you locate around Tatooine. The Empire will pay a bounty on every one you destroy. Good luck.",		"s_aaac7e85":"I don't expect you will need to shoot at anything. Let me be particularly clear: this is a patrol. Keep your guns cold unless you are fired upon first.",		"s_aaa6ec13":"(Salute) Sir!",		"s_a934fd0c":"Go ahead then, try again. The destruction of the pirates benefits the Empire's business in this region. Report back to me when your task is complete.",		"s_a91015df":"You certainly think highly of yourself. Too highly. Until you prove otherwise, you are at the lowest rung on the ladder. Tools do not select how they are used.",		"s_a8c82b1c":"Sir, yes sir!",		"s_a7f76b6d":"We'll see about that.  If you want to enlist then speak to an Imperial Recruiter.  He will put your name on the roster.  I'm certain the Empire can put you to as good use on the ground, as it does in space.",		"s_a79075ab":"Report on the status of your operation against the pirate leader, pilot.",		"s_a742819b":"I've got most of the critical assignments covered right now, but I do have some elective duty missions if you are interested.",		"s_a6574c9a":"Service in the Imperial Navy isn't to be taken lightly.  You'll be expected to follow orders and any association with the Rebellion would be punished severely. Are you sure you want to sign up?",		"s_a607dd0f":"I wear what I please.",		"s_a57e647c":"I'm interested in astromech management.",		"s_a4c65e0b":"With just a little more training, you could be using better weapons.  Missiles can really help to swing the battle your way, and this skill can allow you to use some good ones.",		"s_a490d2c6":"Alright.",		"s_a4622f42":"I don't care about your civil war. I'm just looking for work.",		"s_a3b6d1bc":"Clear as Duralian Tea, sir!",		"s_a2d4dd9d":"I will not fail the Emperor.",		"s_a1088c08":"Just a simple patrol, sir.",		"s_a0d8ac32":"Then be on your way. Dismissed.",		"s_a0129ea3":"I told you before, I wear what I want.",		"s_9ef7bea1":"Motivation doesn't matter if the job gets done.",		"s_9eb2b131":"Return later and I'll have another mission prepared for you. Good day, Initiate.",		"s_9bcd2229":"What kind of assignment is this?",		"s_9a809034":"As it stands, I do have an assignment for you. As you know, ships travel to and from Bestine every day along the Primary Commerce Route. Commercial traffic to Bestine is limited to the route, so we can scan each ship for illegal cargo. I want you to perform a circuit patrol of the Bestine PCR.",		"s_9a79a8e3":"You are a disgrace. Get out of my sight, pilot. I don't want to see you again until you have results. If you perform capably, I might see about fitting you with a nice garbage escort detail.",		"s_989ea72c":"I am aware of how fleets function.",		"s_987445c9":"Thank you, sir.",		"s_976ec302":"Calm down, your payment has been arranged. I've also taken the liberty of submitting your physical profile to the Commissions Office. You stink and you aren't dressed for your position as an Imperial Pilot. A spec TIE pilot flightsuit will be ready for you soon.",		"s_976cba8a":"(Sniff derisively.) You got a job for me or what?",		"s_96c14c06":"Yes, sir. I overcame the enemy with ease.",		"s_969498f6":"I don't want to hear excuses. You haven't earned the right to give excuses. I want you to get back up there and finish that patrol.",		"s_966ca13e":"Ah, yes. You're in my files as a member of the Imperial Navy, but you're not assigned to my roster. What can I do for you?",		"s_95f0e74b":"Even so, I suggest you wear it. It would be a marked improvement. Report back to me when you're ready for more work.",		"s_94ed5057":"I've transferred the patrol coordinates to your datapad.  Try not to fly into anything.",		"s_94eb8fab":"As I said, I'm not convinced their faith in 'volunteers' is justified, and I'm certainly not ready to trust you with more knowledge just yet, in spite of your recent victory.",		"s_9465e2c7":"You must have impressed someone, pilot. You are being posted for consideration to join Storm Squadron. The squadron is a special operations wing based here in the Tatooine system. Their C.O. is a man named Commander Jhon Oberhaur.",		"s_943c7ba6":"I'd like training.",		"s_94131047":"Don't lose it this time.",		"s_93b4f46e":"Cdr. Oberhaur is friendly, but a tough man. He'll work you hard. You aren't officially a member of Storm Squadron yet. You need to impress Cdr. Oberhaur during the application phase to be accepted. You'll need to take this Authorization of Transfer to him. He's currently stationed here in Bestine. You can find his office over in the capital building. Sign this form and give it to him to start.",		"s_930b7f4c":"Your job is to locate and eliminate the pirate leader at the coordinates I have given you. Imperial Naval Command believes a decisive strike against the pirates would cripple, if not eliminate, their operations in this system.",		"s_92c85144":"You flubbed a simple operation. This patrol should have been flawless.",		"s_9237617f":"What about training?",		"s_8fc58e91":"The Empire has recognized your ability and has seen fit to elevate you to the lowest rank of the Naval command echelon. Don't abuse that trust. Commander Oberhaur of the ISD Accuser will handle your assignments from this point on.",		"s_8fc0b08b":"You won't make many friends in the Imperial Navy if you question the faith of everyone you meet.",		"s_8efde2ae":"Yes, sir.",		"s_8e66d267":"You don't have the experience for training, yet. Perform some more duties.",		"s_8df7dba2":"I can fly and I can shoot, but I don't come cheap.",		"s_8d324b72":"I've transferred the patrol coordinates to your datapad. Try harder this time, pilot.",		"s_8cd3467e":"(Salute) For the Emperor.",		"s_8c63d8cd":"You'll wear what you are told to wear. Now get lost. I have other business to attend to. Let me know when you're ready for another job.",		"s_8c262163":"Report back to me when you are finished with your current mission.  You can abort your mission if you want to start over.",		"s_8a6a16c8":"A simple 'sir' is fine, Initiate.",		"s_88ffee3a":"Report back to me when you are ready for some work.",		"s_88241861":"I lost my Application of Transfer.",		"s_87e1d305":"It's kinda ugly lookin'.",		"s_860c425d":"Great, where's my ship?",		"s_85414d61":"(Brag about how you saved some stupid transport.)",		"s_853678d0":"I have an assignment for you. As you know, ships travel to and from Bestine every day along the Primary Commerce Route. Commercial traffic to Bestine is limited to the route, so we can scan each ship for illegal cargo. I want you to perform a circuit patrol of the Bestine PCR.",		"s_84cc9ca1":"The Imperial Navy prides itself on the character and loyalty of its officers. I don't think you understand what it means to be a patriot. The lines are drawn, citizen. You are either with us or you are a Rebel. There is no neutral ground.",		"s_84047858":"(Glare at him, violently.)",		"s_83fc71cf":"What kind of assignment is it?",		"s_83fa9322":"Give me an update on the status of your operation against the pirate leader, pilot.",		"s_83ea480b":"(Glare) Very well. Sir.",		"s_83d1f7de":"Understood, sir!",		"s_838b6daf":"They died cursing my name.",		"s_82f901aa":"Report back to me when you are ready for another duty.",		"s_8273f08f":"Naval Command will be pleased. I didn't expect someone like you to be such an asset to the Empire.",		"s_7ff3bffd":"It never changes with you does it. Here's your payment as well as a bonus for saving the transport. I also received your Imperial flight suit. At least try to look like a pilot and wear it while you're on duty.",		"s_7fdc4805":"As a member of this Navy you will be expected to work with the team when necessary. Your assignments, while small, are critical to Imperial interests in the Outer Rim. If I need you to work with others to achieve those goals, you will do so and you will like it. Is that clear?",		"s_7fa6a6f8":"What did you expect? Glory in the name of the Emperor? That may be what the men and women of the Death Star found, but out here its business as usual. This war will be won through the daily effort of loyal officers doing their assigned duties, not the heroics of a single SpecOps ghost.",		"s_7f6cd2e6":"Listen up. Bestine has become a key base location for Imperial Naval operations in the Outer Rim. Many ships and men are moved through this region on a daily basis. Ships and men consume supplies and uninterrupted delivery of supplies is critical to the integrity of base operations.",		"s_7ef9666e":"They were no match for my skill.",		"s_7e347138":"He's as good as dead.",		"s_7d477c70":"Sir...I...ah...lost my ship control device.",		"s_7c96fa97":"Imperial Naval Command believes a decisive strike against the pirates would cripple their operations in this system.",		"s_7c8aca1b":"Good choice.  Report back when you are ready for an assignment.",		"s_7c4d87dd":"Pilot Initiate. Your success in responding to pirate aggression during patrol has encouraged the local Naval Command. Despite their enthusiasm, I am still not convinced their faith in voluntary conscripts is justified. I am honestly surprised you survived.",		"s_7baeb853":"I expect to be paid for each kill.",		"s_7ba2ac61":"No excuses! Get back out there and complete your mission, or I'll find someone who can!",		"s_79ab4bbe":"[Escort Duty] I'm interested in escorting transports.",		"s_78dbec92":"Whatever. Sounds like easy money.",		"s_786f3cf7":"I want to study something else.",		"s_780a9b6f":"A patrol? I want something to shoot. Shooting always pays better.",		"s_7796b57c":"Great, I can't wait to try this baby out.",		"s_76de9d3f":"My talents lie in the direction of hunting men, not patrols.",		"s_7611fee0":"It is the Emperor's will.",		"s_7537c07c":"I think I recognize you. You're on a wanted list I think...",		"s_72ed61c":"Yes, volunteers. Under normal circumstances it takes years of formal education to become a flight officer in the Imperial Navy. Recently, Rebel opposition has become more direct. We want to recruit new pilots for support duty, freeing up combat pilots for the front lines. Are you a pilot?",		"s_7279069a":"Your job is to locate and eliminate the pirate leader. Imperial Naval Command believes a decisive strike against the pirates would cripple, if not eliminate, their operations in this system.",		"s_726bd76b":"Wing Epsilon Zeta, operating out of the garrisoned ISD Accuser, usually handles supply security operations.  Escort, patrol, and the like. They are overtaxed and have asked for additional support. Your job will be to fly a standard patrol sweep through the region.",		"s_713afe89":"Yeah? Well you can tell 'em where to find me so they can pay up.",		"s_7090182":"What?!",		"s_703a1e55":"Now, do you have further business here? I am quite busy.",		"s_701f8a8e":"Report back to me when you are ready for your next mission.",		"s_6fcaa2a":"You've earned it, pilot. You have exceeded the expectations of this program and of myself. Your duty has not ended, however. Return when you are ready to take on another operation.",		"s_6e62e955":"You should be. An officer rank is usually only given to those who graduate Naval Command School. All combat pilots in the Imperial Navy hold at least the rank of Pilot Officer. The Empire has recognized your ability and has seen fit to elevate you to the lowest rank of the command echelon.",		"s_6d8d3e00":"I will not fail you, sir.",		"s_6cb86d0c":"Ah...yes. Good day then.",		"s_6b63ee3":"Stand at attention, Pilot. Having shown skill in combat situations you are being elevated to an Outer Rim security detail. For the time being, I will handle your assignments, briefings, and deployment. You will operate as an independent agent until we determine a specific placement for you.",		"s_6a7d2af7":"The purpose of the mission is to assess your ability to pilot a ship and follow basic instructions. If you pass, you will be considered for more dangerous assignments. You are to report back to me upon completion. Is this clear, Pilot Initiate?",		"s_6a128385":"What is a duty?",		"s_69d5148f":"Thank you sir.",		"s_6988fd93":"Now then, your mission. Bestine has become a key base location for Imperial Naval operations in the Outer Rim. Many ships and men are moved through this region on a daily basis. Ships and men consume supplies and uninterrupted delivery of supplies is critical to the integrity of base operations.",		"s_6971748f":"So, it seems I was right after all. Your success with the pirates was just luck and the trust of Naval Command was misplaced. I suppose you could try hunting down the pirates again, but you would probably still fail.",		"s_6942ec7e":"You want me to eliminate him.",		"s_6942663f":"Recently, Rebel opposition has become more direct. We want to recruit new pilots for support duty, freeing up combat pilots for the front lines. Under normal circumstances it takes years of formal education to become a flight officer in the Imperial Navy.",		"s_68c831e7":"Yes. I want to be in the Imperial Navy.",		"s_6868d86b":"Return to me when you are ready to take the mission.",		"s_6705894e":"Service in the Imperial Navy isn't to be taken lightly. You'll be expected to follow orders and any association with the Rebellion would be punished severely.  Are you sure you want to sign up? You aren't exactly Imperial Pilot quality.",		"s_670201ae":"I need a ship.",		"s_66ac46dc":"A patrol is somewhat less than my ability. I prefer a warrior's assignment.",		"s_668cac00":"I need to think about the mission and figure out what went wrong.",		"s_65dcd253":"I'd rather suck plasma than work for you.",		"s_64b01ff":"That may be, but they haven't stood on the command deck of an Imperial Star Destroyer while facing down a squadron of enemy hostiles. Sir, I have no time for the Imperial Inquisition. My record shows that I am a patriot.",		"s_63f41edf":"A glorious achievement, I'm sure. You responded to a rapidly changing situation, eliminated the enemy, and helped secure valuable medical supplies. The Naval Command is pleased with your adaptability.",		"s_63380f34":"I've always been an independent agent. I work alone.",		"s_6337731b":"I suggest you reign in your enthusiasm. I need you to have a clear mind up there. Do not underestimate your enemy. We have Intelligence reports on areas of high pirate activity that will be good places for you to start your search for the pirates. Report back to me when you've completed the objective.",		"s_627065f5":"I work alone and then I get paid.",		"s_61f0326":"Figured if I didn't, you wouldn't pay me.",		"s_6138854f":"Do you have business with the Imperial Navy? No? Then I suggest that you come back another time.",		"s_60c81a4c":"Absolutely, sir.",		"s_601e26c5":"Here's your salary for the operation and another bonus for exceptional duty. I also received your Imperial flight suit, but you'll never fit into this...Why don't you take this bandolier, instead.  At least you can keep your things organized.  Your helmet will take a while longer, the inertia electronics have to be calibrated for every pilot. You wouldn't want to black out during a fast maneuver.",		"s_5fdd32ea":"Excellent. Deliver a report to me upon completion of the mission.",		"s_5f418636":"They were dead money. Now I want to be paid.",		"s_5ebce168":"Actually, I'd like to do this later.",		"s_5e6be58d":"(Nod silently, but stare intensely.)",		"s_5e3cf461":"I'm interested in Imperial technology.",		"s_5ce97ee2":"Imperial intelligence has located a suspected pirate leader. He seems to frequent a staging area close to the Bestine Orbital Region. I'm transferring the coordinates to your datapad now.",		"s_5cd3c77":"There are those who believe the officers lack faith.",		"s_5c8922d8":"That's the spirit, Pilot Initiate! You're starting to sound like an Imperial Pilot should. We have Intelligence reports on areas of high pirate activity that will be good places for you to start your search for the pirates. Report back to me upon completion of your task.",		"s_5c709097":"It is not the Emperor's will.",		"s_5c5b19e2":"Yes, Sir!",		"s_5c4e4259":"Whatever. Like I said before, just name the target and the price.",		"s_5b34a8a8":"In the Imperial Navy we don't pick our postings, they pick us. The Naval Command feels you make a good candidate for Security.",		"s_59c8db72":"Sir, yes, sir!",		"s_577aca95":"I'm interested in weapons.",		"s_566cddb5":"This is a patrol and only a patrol. The purpose of the assignment is to assess your ability to pilot a ship and follow basic instructions. I will be very surprised if you manage to succeed. I've transferred the patrol route to your datapad. You are to report back to me upon completion.  Is this clear, Pilot Initiate?",		"s_565cc8ba":"I live only to serve the Emperor, sir.",		"s_561d4b08":"I will have you confined if you cannot control yourself.",		"s_52b712dc":"(Relate the details of the distress call.)",		"s_523f6698":"This sounds like something that might be worthy.",		"s_518959d2":"Good, I have a lot of work for you. Pirate activity in the area is still fairly high. There are plenty of pirates to hunt or you could help escort transports moving supplies.",		"s_5070b6e":"Very good. By the powers vested in me by the Imperial Naval Command, under the ever watchful eye of the Emperor, I hereby conscript you to service with the non-officer flight rank of Pilot Initiate. May you serve the Empire dutifully. Welcome to the Imperial Navy.",		"s_506aa7cf":"Sorry, pilot, but you are carrying way too much stuff. I hope you don't take all of that into your ship with you. Drop some of it and come back for your form.",		"s_4efae056":"I'm surprised those pirates didn't turn your ship into a burning heap. Here's your payment. Report back to me when you're ready for another job.",		"s_4e95ac78":"Service Pilot Initiate, it is beyond my understanding how you could fail to achieve the objective of flying such a simple circuit patrol.",		"s_4d7a1ae4":"Spaced him. Now, about my fee?",		"s_4d41f7fe":"Dismissed.",		"s_4c97441f":"Report to me when you have completed your mission. May the Emperor guide you to victory.",		"s_4c6875a7":"In this outfit, you serve as I will. Now get out to that patrol. Report to me when you're done.",		"s_49af5773":"You heard me.  If you ever want to fly for the Imperial Navy again, you'd better improve your standing with the Empire!",		"s_4854758d":"I would like to request a mission.",		"s_47691a6":"Report to me when you are ready to attempt the patrol again.",		"s_46c8d76c":"Show respect, Pilot! Outside you might be street scum, but in this office you are a pilot of the Imperial Navy. You will demonstrate the proper respect to your senior officer or you will demonstrate how to clean a sewage compactor. Is that clear?",		"s_465b51a7":"I am sick of this insubordinate, disrespectful attitude. Shape up or you'll find yourself in a detention block.",		"s_4608dfe8":"The Imperial Navy is the finest fleet in the galaxy. The brave and the bold. We command the Empire's starships and fighters. We are the hammer of Imperial justice. All members of the Imperial Navy are officers, however we are now starting to recruit non-officer pilots for limited support duty.",		"s_438b2349":"So far you've been flying a basic TIE.  The normal TIE is quite a bit more complicated than that.  For one thing, you'll find that you can install better components on it... better weapons, better armor, and so on.",		"s_431ac3d4":"Very good. How may I help you, Initiate?",		"s_42dfe6db":"Indeed. The Empire rarely enlists non-Humans as pilots, and so we are poorly prepared to equip someone such as yourself. But do not be discouraged. Your current standing in the Imperial Navy is a testament to your abilities.",		"s_42bfca2f":"If you've got work that pays, I'll listen.",		"s_42be2dbc":"Tighten it up, pilot! If you fly half as bad as you smell, you'll end up space scrap. Discipline is key to victory.",		"s_42b12aab":"Perhaps they merely find them surprising coming from you. Here's your payment as well as a bonus for saving the transport. I also received your Imperial flight suit, but you're much too large to fit into this... take this bandolier instead.  At the very least, it will help you organize your things.",		"s_40f3848e":"I'm interested in space combat training.",		"s_3f904297":"Lost it? How do you lose one of those massive things? Alright, I'll imprint you a new one, but don't lose it. They only give me a limited allotment of these disks every week.",		"s_3f6a8711":"Thank you, sir. I do my best.",		"s_3de840b5":"I need to spend some time practicing.",		"s_3d5b4720":"Why would the Imperial Navy need to...outsource?",		"s_3ca32099":"They're as good as dead.",		"s_3b510c1a":"The purpose of this patrol assignment isn't to add any additional security to the Commerce Route. I highly doubt you would be effective in a combat situation. This is to assess your ability to pilot a ship and follow basic instructions. I've transferred the patrol route to your datapad. You are to fly to each point in the patrol route and then report back to me upon completion. Is this clear, Pilot Initiate?",		"s_3b3aabc1":"I'd like training, sir.",		"s_3b1fee95":"Report to me when you are ready to give it another try.",		"s_3ab04e84":"As much as it pains me to say it, I hereby conscript you to service with the non-officer flight rank of Pilot Initiate. May you serve the Empire dutifully. Come back when you're ready for your 'job.'",		"s_39f8ff3b":"How else may I serve the Empire?",		"s_39aba3b6":"(Tell him about your victory in battle.)",		"s_3988f447":"We are the greatest fleet in the galaxy, surmounting even the warships of the old Republic. Nonetheless, Rebel opposition has become more direct. We want to recruit new pilots for support duty, freeing up combat pilots for the front lines. Are you a pilot?",		"s_388cfea9":"The Empire is recruiting volunteer pilots?",		"s_37eb1d12":"I'd rather not sign up right now, sir.",		"s_37ae364a":"That overconfidence will get you killed some day. We have Intelligence reports on areas of high pirate activity that will be good places for you to start your search for the pirates. Report back to me upon completion of your task.",		"s_37979335":"Report back to me when you are finished with the patrol.",		"s_37910d75":"With the recent increase in pirate activity, our supply transports are at risk. The Empire would like to assign at least one TIE pilot to every transport operating in the Tatooine region. You will be paid for every successful escort operation you complete.",		"s_378987b0":"Let me know if you decide you want to work with us.",		"s_36f7cf1e":"Perhaps they merely find them surprising coming from you. Here's your payment as well as a bonus for saving the transport. I also received your Imperial flight suit. Please wear it while you are on duty.",		"s_36b3ba5a":"Report on your patrol, pilot.",		"s_35daf5c2":"You responded to a rapidly changing situation, eliminated the enemy, and helped secure valuable medical supplies. I'm proud of you, pilot. You've come a long way in a short time. The Empire could use more people like you.",		"s_34ff44c5":"Maybe you should reread your flight manual. Come back when you want to try again.",		"s_34bc5f5e":"You don't have the experience to apply to training.",		"s_34975e9f":"Report back to me when you've successfully completed the mission.",		"s_323e4b0d":"I will decide when you are ready for training, Pilot.  And right now I say you aren't.  Now, about your new role in the Outer Rim security detail...",		"s_31967d85":"Does this mean I get a new handler? I'm sick of working with you.",		"s_311a3b47":"Stand at attention. Now, deliver your report on the Commerce Route patrol.",		"s_30a48366":"Perhaps. By the powers vested in me by the Imperial Naval Command, under the ever watchful eye of the Emperor, I hereby commend you and bestow upon you the rank of Pilot Officer.",		"s_3060d15b":"(Patronizing) The Emperor himself will take note of you, I'm sure. Here is your salary as well as a little extra. The Emperor rewards dutiful service.",		"s_304d169e":"I am honored, sir.",		"s_2fe328e":"By the powers vested in me by the Imperial Naval Command, under the ever watchful eye of the Emperor, I hereby conscript you to service with the non-officer flight rank of Pilot Initiate. May you serve the Empire dutifully. Welcome to the Imperial Navy.",		"s_2f923a47":"Yes, you're probably right about that. You managed to help secure valuable medical supplies. A lot of people owe you for your bravery.",		"s_2e935a2c":"Good to see you again, pilot. I hope your new assignment is going well. The voluntary conscription program has been quite successful. If there is anything I can help you with, let me know. Although you are overqualified, I can offer you some basic missions and duties. I can also train you in simple skills, in case you need a refresher.",		"s_2e48b5f1":"It's no secret that Imperial pilots utilize some of the best starfighter tactics the galaxy has ever seen.  I can get you started on the road to mastering these uniquely Imperial procedures.",		"s_2d5d4bf0":"I'm interested in a duty.",		"s_2d4337c5":"I've seen your face! You're a known Rebel pilot! Guards, arrest this man!",		"s_2c3d0c07":"I will find and destroy the enemy, sir.",		"s_2bca7dec":"Apparently there are few skilled warriors in this Navy, if my actions are surprising.",		"s_2a1af001":"I defeated him with ease.",		"s_2a1015e6":"(Don't salute.)",		"s_2879b9e3":"Indeed.  You didn't seem the type.  You realize that enlisting with the ground forces - even as a covert operative - could open you to attack from Rebels when you least expect it?",		"s_28586fd5":"Very well.",		"s_28526663":"Later!  This situation is urgent.  I'll train you AFTER you have completed this special assignment.  Got it?",		"s_2844cc74":"Pilot, you are a disgrace.  You have been assisting the Rebel Alliance against the Empire.  This will not be tolerated.  You are grounded until further notice!",		"s_2800bbf1":"Yes, I've heard. Saving that transport was very uncharacteristic of you.",		"s_266d5a8d":"I'm not sure that's the right kind of motivation, citizen. The Imperial Navy is the finest fleet in the galaxy. We command the Empire's starships and fighters. We are the hammer of Imperial justice. The Navy wants patriots who will fight for the security of the Empire.",		"s_264e2e43":"Or your ego. Here is your payment for a successful mission and an additional sum to compensate for hazards encountered.",		"s_263baa57":"(Brag about how you bagged several raiders.)",		"s_25d6b961":"Their destruction is inevitable.",		"s_259013cd":"[Destroy Duty] I'm interested in hunting pirates.",		"s_2562a051":"For the Emperor. Sir.",		"s_248cfc90":"(Relate information on your inability to defeat the pirate leader.)",		"s_24890a54":"This recognition should have happened a long time ago.",		"s_247ae5a6":"Here is your salary for the mission. This one was worth double the normal rate. I've also received your Imperial TIE pilot helmet. Unfortunately, these standard issue helmets are not suited to meet your, uh... cranial proportions. Nevertheless, keep it as a symbol of the technological and military might of the Empire.",		"s_23600775":"(Yawn.) My payment?",		"s_22564d44":"Sir, I can fly. It would be an honor to serve the Empire.",		"s_22451e60":"We serve as the Emperor wills.",		"s_21309acb":"I'm no Inquisitor. I merely seek the will of the Emperor.",		"s_1d0e7364":"I'm transferring a ship authorization and control device to your datapad. You'll need this to use your TIE Fighter. Should you lose your control device and access to your ship, you can apply for a new one at any time. Unfortunately, I'm only authorized to supply you with access to our low end TIE technology.",		"s_1cccf249":"You are not a pilot in my squadron, and therefore unable to fly any of the missions I have. Go back to your unit and speak with your commanding officer.",		"s_1a5d8b73":"Don't underestimate him. A particularly skilled and charismatic leader might explain the increase in the pirate activity. You must continue to hunt him down.",		"s_1a100286":"I think you need to prove you're worhty first, don't you?  Now stand at attention!",		"s_19ff301f":"What kind of training?",		"s_19d7d16a":"It's too bad you can't wear it. It would be a marked improvement. Report back to me when you're ready for more work.",		"s_19288eda":"I think I need to rethink things.",		"s_1768c7c4":"Just a minor set back. Those pirates won't last long.",		"s_17519607":"Good luck, pilot. Stay sharp.",		"s_16fc739e":"I...",		"s_16f8c58a":"I will not disappoint, sir.",		"s_16c1201f":"Ah, joy. A briefing.",		"s_169df3bb":"Never mind.",		"s_163d48b6":"(Take the form.)",		"s_16244233":"I'm ready for a mission, sir.",		"s_15daf24e":"You don't take complements very well. This one was worth double the normal rate. I've also received your Imperial TIE pilot helmet. Unfortunately, these standard issue helmets are not suited to meet your, uh... cranial proportions.",		"s_15a6458f":"What is Oberhaur like?",		"s_154024b0":"Get out of my office, trash! Guards, throw this scum out!",		"s_153a5c24":"You are the most obstinate person I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. Report back to me when you are ready for another mission.",		"s_14aa29c":"I haven't exactly enjoyed your company, either. Yes, it does mean you will have a new commanding officer. I'll skip the formality. You are now a Pilot Officer. Personally, I think it's a mistake, but Naval Command likes the results you've shown.",		"s_13a199af":"Why recruit volunteers? Is not the strength of the Emperor's Navy unmatched?",		"s_13195064":"Here's your salary for the operation and another bonus for exceptional duty. I also received your Imperial flight suit. Please wear it while you are on duty. Your helmet will take a while longer, the inertia electronics have to be calibrated for every pilot. You wouldn't want to black out during a fast maneuver.",		"s_11fcdd9f":"I'm interested in hearing about the Imperial Navy, sir.",		"s_1144321a":"Don't get too cocky, it might have just been luck. I've convinced the Naval Command to test your abilities further. We want to crush the pirates and demonstrate that Imperial resolve remains strong. I want you to get into space and destroy any Commerce Raiders you find. Your mission is to eliminate four of the pirates.",		"s_1091c96a":"I'm done for now.",		"s_10675ec9":"Keep quiet and listen. Bestine has become a key base location for Imperial Naval operations in the Outer Rim. Many ships and men are moved through this region on a daily basis. Ships and men consume supplies and uninterrupted delivery of supplies is critical to the integrity of base operations.",		"s_101a6629":"Report back to me when you are ready.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (tatooine_imperial_trainer_1.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
