Maybe I'd better do something else then.",		"s_f580c83d":"Endrost Alloy",		"s_ef01f5ee":"Yes, but I'm afraid you don't have the even the most basic skills needed to help out.

The binary load lifter droid QT-QC has the schematics you'll need for the project. You'll also give it the ingredients you make.

May the Force be with you.",		"s_6c81c99f":"Yes, we need people to help create energy shields for the village. You'll need to contribute at least %DI ingredients to the project.
