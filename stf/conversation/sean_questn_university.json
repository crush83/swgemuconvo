		"s_e656ba0c":"Good day.",		"s_dcf7aa7a":"Of course. Here you are.",		"s_dac635d2":"I see that you don't have enough room to get the evidence you seek. Please come back when you have room.",		"s_b9b27823":"Thank you.",		"s_b8a92f09":"I see. I guess there's no hurry... just come back you have more space.",		"s_9c880546":"I hope you've gone to school. We could really use more... educated folks nowadays.",		"s_99711fbf":"Again, you still don't have enough room. Come back when you do.",		"s_7e78bf8f":"Yes, can I have the evidence, please?",		"s_7c259594":"Sean Trenwell... oh yes! I remember him. Unfortunately, he was a particularly bad student. I would always catch him trying to cheat during exams. He barely graduated from the University. In fact, he could even be considered a fake. I really don't want him representing our people in this election.",		"s_799ad811":"Mmhmm--Oh really? I actually have something that might help you. I think you could use it as evidence. Yes! Here it is. I always keep the grades of my students. Here you are.",		"s_7291fe2e":"Not yet. I still need to make room.",		"s_70145cf1":"You again. I'm still quite busy, and I see you still have those papers I gave you from Mr. Trenwell's school days. How's this... you leave me to my work, and I won't ask for those back?",		"s_656e8f97":"I see that you've returned. Do you have enough room now?",		"s_5ec23736":"Oh? I could really use your help...",		"s_5788afea":"I'm in the middle of grading papers. Did you need help with something?",		"s_3c4a2f4":"I'm too busy to talk right now. I'm grading papers. You seem like you'd be interested in voting at the capitol. They're holding an election.",		"s_36904010":"I was told to talk to you about Sean Trenwell.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (sean_questn_university.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
