Between you and me, anyone who's sympathetic with the Rebels should be careful. I've seen too many singled out and executed nowadays.",		"s_7f471bf9":"I'm here to investigate the background story of Victor Visalis. He's running as the Officer of Defense in the upcoming election. I have a bad feeling bout him. Every politician has a bad side, some horrible story in their past. Anyway, you need to vote at the capitol. Talk with the governor for more information.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (bestine_rumor11.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
