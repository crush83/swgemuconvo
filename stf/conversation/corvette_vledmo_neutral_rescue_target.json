		"s_ecd754dd":"Listen punk, I don't need to wait on some blaster waving, wannabe space hero to rescue me. I've been getting myself out of this kind of situation since you were toe-high to a bantha. Now get out of my way, I have an escape pod to catch.",		"s_c5413576":"Hehe, you came to 'rescue' me? Yeah I'm sure Jabba was real worried. Not like I needed the help... was just about to bust out of here myself.",		"s_4751b5d0":"Yeah right... sure you were.",		"s_46770350":"Look...instead of trying to make polite conversation, how about you let me actually finish escaping? Sound good? Okay.",		"s_3d453e53":"Well Jabba thought it was best we'd escort you back to safety.",		"s_3a6b92ce":"I'm sure he did. You can tell him to get in touch with me through the regular channels. I'm not going anywhere near his stinking sand castle for a while. Now if you excuse me, I have an escape pod to catch.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (corvette_vledmo_neutral_rescue_target.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
