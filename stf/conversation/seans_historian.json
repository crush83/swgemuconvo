		"s_fcdb7174":"That's a shame. I'll inform Sean about it, then.",		"s_ed53cd9c":"Okay. Be sure to show it to me if you do.",		"s_e547fd1e":"Yeah?",		"s_b30bd73c":"Yes, I did.",		"s_9c1a8dd7":"No, let me keep looking.",		"s_8d32acbf":"Did you find anything?",		"s_79636e28":"We recently found this wreckage. It is rumored to be the Red-Sin Valon. How exciting! Sean Trenwell funds us out of his own pocket. We hope to find interesting things here. You should talk to Sean to see if he needs any help.",		"s_67e6df55":"Okay.",		"s_65275fb4":"Ah! You must be the new assistant. Welcome to the crash site of the Red-Sin Valon.

Tell me the history.",		"s_5ec0adb6":"I've decided not to. Good bye.",		"s_4d42d7da":"Anyway, you should check the wreckage to see what you find. If you do find anything, you can bring it to me.

It is rumored to be the Red-Sin Valon. How exciting! Sean Trenwell funds us out of his own pocket. We hope to find interesting things here. You should talk to Sean when he's in office.",		"s_2fceb7e3":"And be careful!",		"s_27540308":"Well done! What an interesting piece of history. You'd think it would have been destroyed in these dreadful sand storms. Guess not! Take it to Sean. He'll be excited.",		"s_1f6355d4":"The Red-Sin Valon carried the first of the new settlers to Tatooine. The captain of the ship and her crew members helped found Bestine. Despite the early difficulties--a severe economic depression, lack of water and so forth--Bestine survived and became the thriving city we see today. There's so much more depth to it...",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (seans_historian.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
