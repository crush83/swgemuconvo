You do not need to speak with me.",		"s_3315cf03":"Normally, those who have helped us so willingly in the past are not called on to do so again. However, if you wish, I can reset your service history with the Rebellion. Do you want me to reset your history?",		"s_2eadaa06":"If you like, I can reset your service history and you can assist the Rebellion again.
