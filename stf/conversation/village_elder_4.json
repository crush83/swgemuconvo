He's right over there.",		"s_de1f69ee":"Well they are going to have a tough time with all the new defenses.",		"s_d1431da3":"Apparently not. I think they are looking to finish us off this time.",		"s_bdd3bae5":"Here you are.  Remember you may use the crystal to view your progress.",		"s_ae755ac3":"Well we need good skirmishers to meet them head on. Speak to Captain Sarguillo, right over there.",		"s_aba5c1a8":"You look pretty well defended.",		"s_a098d669":"Again? Haven't they learned their lesson?",		"s_9dc8bf5d":"I seem to have misplaced my Force crystal.  May I have another?",		"s_97092ac2":"I'm a crafter, what can I do in a battle?",		"s_8c109ae0":"I am sure Sivarra will need all the help she can get.
