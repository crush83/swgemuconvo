Well...yeah I suppose it's probably getting a little jammed with all of the work we've been putting it through. You can find the Snaff Grease in the back. Hurry up though, there's probably a bunch of ships waiting to be fueled up.",		"s_b7141451":"Get moving now.",		"s_b44f916c":"I don't get it. Look, I'm really busy. Can you come back later?",		"s_b0c60048":"What? You don't scrub a plasma injector. Those things are stored in sealed containers and fused into engines. Is this some kind of joke? Did Jeffy put you up to this?",		"s_8358e7c8":"I'm sorry to hear that.",		"s_76ac95c":"Uh...okay...",		"s_6aa58622":"I'm really, really busy. It's a complete mess around here. The Empire has been laying it into Nym for some reason and the damaged ships keep rolling in. I've had to replace two engine cores today alone!",		"s_67a590c3":"I'm here to clean the antimatter condenser.",		"s_62f865dd":"I'm here to scrub the plasma injector.",		"s_60900624":"Hahaha! That's funny stuff!",		"s_5afecbb7":"Uh...yeah Jeffy. Funny huh?",		"s_501ea131":"Scrub the? Excuse me?",		"s_4c3cb236":"Yeah, well it's my sob story. Beat it so I can get to work. I don't think you're supposed to be back here anyway.",		"s_0":"",		"do_not_edit":"The English version of this file (nym_technician_2.stf) is automatically generated by the SwgConversationEditor."
