		"good_luck":"Good luck.",		"leaving":"I'll be going now.",		"imggcu_loc":"Heh, you know about those, eh?  Unfortunately, I don't know where they store 'em. But, if the Imperials are getting ready to ship the IMGGCUs off of Lok, the explosives are probably stored in a locker or crate, awaiting transport. You'll have to look around a bit, I'm sure.",		"imggcu_where":"Where are the IMGGCUs?",		"hard_drive_loc":"Well, once you get inside, you'll find four corridors leading from the central room. The computer room is to the west, I think.  Somewhere in there you'll find your memory module.",		"hard_drive_where":"Where's the memory module?",		"other_dangers_info":"Well, I hear they're doing some other, illegal experiments in that base. Creating monsters that will rip your arms off and beat you to death with them. Or so the rumors go.",		"other_dangers":"What other dangers?",		"lab_info":"The lab, eh?  Yeah, I know about it.  It's pretty well-guarded. Rather than rely on General Otto and his goons, the Imperials in charge of the lab hired mercenaries to protect it. They're all blood thirsty and will shoot on sight. The scientists shouldn't give you too much trouble, but there might be other dangers...",		"bet_made_50":"I'll bet 50 credits.",		"bet_made_10":"I'll bet 10 credits.",		"bet_made_5":"I'll bet 5 credits.",		"bet_how_much":"How much you wanna bet?  Can't play without credits you know.",		"too_bad":"That's too bad.  You might have made some money.",		"no_thanks":"No thanks.",		"game_description":"It's called Desert Draw.  It's really simple.  We each have three cards, we both pick a card and show them at the same time. The winner gets the credits.",		"lab_stuff":"From what I hear, the lab is a secret weapons project. The scientists there are researching high-end explosives. Really dangerous stuff. Blow you outta your boots, or knock a building offa its foundation. I'm sure that's why Nym wants into the lab. It's incredibly well-guarded. Even a bunch of storm commandoes couldn't bust in, I'd wager. Aside from the dangerous mercs that are crawling all over the base, the lab is patrolled by droidekas… ",		"tell_me_more":"Tell me about the Imperial Lab.",		"begin_game_five_wins":"Well, you're pretty good.  I'll play another hand if you want, or you can ask me some questions...",		"you_win_s":"Stang! Your Sarlacc swallows my Bounty Hunter.  You win.",		"you_lose_s":"My Thermal Detonator blows up your Sarlacc!  I win!  You lose.",		"you_win_bh":"Your Bounty Hunter disarms my Thermal Detonator.  Stang!",		"you_lose_bh":"My Sarlacc eats your Bounty Hunter!  You lose.",		"play_again":"Let's play again.",		"you_lose_td":"My Bounty Hunter disarms the Thermal Detonator.  You lose!",		"you_win_td":"Your Thermal Detonator blows up my Sarlacc.  You win.",		"tie":"We both picked the same card. It's a tie.",		"bounty_hunter":"Bounty Hunter.",		"sarlacc":"Sarlacc.",		"thermal_detonator":"Thermal Detonator.",		"begin_game":"Ok, I've picked my card.  Which one are you going to go with?",		"no_games":"No, I don't want to play.",		"explain_rules":"We each have three cards. A Bounty Hunter, the Sarlacc, and a Thermal Detonator.  I pick one, you pick one, then we compare.  Bounty Hunter beats a Thermal Detonator. Thermal Detonator beats a Sarlacc, and Sarlacc beats the Bounty Hunter. It's really just that simple. Wanna try a hand?",		"sure_lets_play":"Ok, I'm game.  Let's do it.",		"game_rules":"How do we know who wins?",		"explain_game":"We'll play Desert Draw. The game is simple. Just six cards. I pick one of mine and hold it behind my back, then you pick one of yours and then we compare them to see who wins. Simple, eh?",		"nym_rules":"I like Nym. He's helped me out of a few scrapes over the years. He even bought up all my markers in the galaxy. Now, I'm in his pocket, but it's better than being dead.",		"games_first":"I won't say anything until we've played some cards.  You ready?",		"sure":"Let's play.",		"what_game":"Tell me about the game.",		"play_game":"Interested in wagering a little cash?  Maybe making some money?  I have a game that's perfect. Wanna hear about it?",		"talk_nym":"Tell me about Nym.",		"play_a_game":"Sure, let's play.",		"tell_me_something":"What can you tell me right now?",		"nym_sent_you":"I've been expecting you. Nym was supposed to send someone to meet me days ago… But, before I give you any information, let's play a game."
